    "title": "Mahmud II",
    "content": "Mahmud II (1808 - 1838) Mahmud II replaced his brother Mustafa as the sultan. He made wide-ranging reforms following in the footsteps of Selim. Personality Sened-i Ittifak Reforms Vaka-i Hayriye Personality People called him the gavur(infidel) sultan because of the stubborn, single-minded nature of his reforms without and regard for public demands. He understood the importance of a self-image (as with many rulers after the French Revolution) and wanted to expose himself to his people. He put his portrait in state offfices. Sened-i Ittifak Mahmud thought that he had to come to term with local notables to perform his reforms even though it was unusual for a sultan to do so. He signed an agreement with them in 1808. The empire became more centralized as a result. Even though he signed the document, he never ratified it. This shows his reservations about the agreement. He will still do anything to get rid of local notables. Reforms He performed reforms in many different areas. He increased the number of people working for the state. Created the first postal service, and planned projects for expanding the road network. The first census was performed. To gather information and see who was eligible for military service. Women were not included in the census. The first official newspaper was published. Cofeehouses became important places for sharing of ideas. Sultans sent spies to coffeehouses to gather information. He opened the translation office. Opened a medical school. In those times, a good education meant either religious or military education. Medical school provided a new, more scientific method of learning more in tune with the rest of the world. Small exchange programs to send students abroad. In an expedition to Morocco, he saw and decided to adopt fez, thinking that it unifies people under one view. This caused a lot of criticism. The first fez factory was created in Feshane. Vaka-i Hayriye Mahmud invited janissaries to an event in a square, in 1828. Turns out if was a trap and janissaries were attacked from all angles once they entered the square. This practically destroyed janissaries. He created a new army, called Victorious Army of Muhammad.",

    "content": "Mustafa IV (1807 - 1808) Became the sultan after Selim was dethroned. Got along well with Janissaries, did not question much. Deposed by rebels led after Alemdar Mustafa Pasha and replaced by his brother Mahmud II. Rise to Power Alemdar Mustafa Pasha Rise to Power Mustafa became the new sultan after Selim left the throne in an eventful manner. With his reign, Janissaries (whom he got along well with) started finding and murdering people who supported Selim and his reforms. Alemdar Mustafa Pasha Alemdar was a reformist commander, supporting Selim. After Selim’s fall, he brought his army from Bulgaria to Istanbul to bring Selim back but Selim was already executed. They fought against the rebels led by Kabakci Mustafa and suppressed them. They took control. When Mustafa IV learend of these events, he ordered Selim and Mahmud to be killed and Selim’s body was shown to Alemdar’s people. Afterwards, they dethroned Mustafa and Mahmud, who managed to overcome the hitmen sent by his brother, became the new sultan. Therefore, Mustafa’s efforts to rollback Selim’s reforms failed. His successor Mahmud was also a reformist.",

    "title": "Selim III",
    "content": "Selim III (1789 - 1807) Took the throne in 1789. He was a reformist. Opened new schools, embassies, and created a new army. He was eventually dethroned and imprisoned by the Janissaries. His cousin Mustafa IV became the new sultan. Personality State of the Empire Reforms Nizam-i Cedit Janissaries Kabakci Mustafa Personality Selim was a well-educated, modernist sultan. He had a cautious personality. Did not want to cause problems with reforms considering the state of the Empire. State of the Empire When Selim became the sultan, the Empire was not in good shape. There was an economic crisis and protests against tax rates. There were nationalistic rebellions emerging in the Balkans. Reforms Opened new engineering schools. Opened new embassies in major European capitals. Before then, it was thought that not opening embassies in other countries showed the superiority of Ottomans as opening an embassy meant recognizing the other country. Selim was aware of the importance of democratic relations with other countries. Nizam-i Cedit (New Order) Selim created a new army called Nizam-i Cedit based on Western principles. It was the first of its kind in Ottoman history. Janissaries refused to join the new army, but the army became successful. They beat Napoleon’s army in Egypt. Selim also invited French instructors to train new soldiers. This also is a key indicator of good French-Ottoman relations. Janissaries Janissaries played a key role in the Ottoman army. They were meant to be loyal servants to the sultan. They were supposed to be a part of the military alone. It was forbidden for them to marry and have children. However, after Selim’s military reforms such as the new army, they started vocally protesting. They started to get married, have children, and get involved with trade. Janissaries became a part of society, not the state. These were alarming developments for the sultan. Kabakci Mustafa In the year 1807, Kabakci Mustafa led the Janissaries to a rebellion against the sultan. Selim was forced the disband the new army, and step down as the sultan. His cousin Mustafa IV became the new sultan.",

    "title": "Tanzimat Era",
    "content": "Tanzimat Era Tanzimat (to regulate) Era is an era of reforms. Through the Tanzimat and Islahat edicts, power shifted from the sultan to bureucracy. The sultans of this era Abdulmecit and Abdulaziz were not so effective. Bureucrats such as Ali Pasha, Fuat Pasha, and Mustafa Resit Pasa stand out. Reforms Sultans Tanzimat Edict Islahat Edict Young Ottomans Reforms Reasons The main reason behind the reforms was the thereatening aspect of emerging global modernity. Problems There were 3 main problems with the reforms: They created a duality. New rules were not completely able to replace old traditions. Their top-down nature contradicted with the values they were supporting. Reforms came directly from the top without much regard for public opinion. Reactions. Neither Muslims nor non-Muslims were happy with the reforms. Legacy The reforms reinforced duality in almost all areas of life. The idea of Ottomanism did not have much effect on non-Muslim people. Contradiction of bureucratuc centralization and political fragmentation. Majalla: A combination of French penal code and court decisions made by kadis. Written by Ahmet Cevdet Pasha. Clashes New Old Civil courts Sharia courts Modern universities Old medresses An academy of modern sciences Ulema gatherings European theater Traditional shadow puppet show The novel Divan poetry Sultans Abdulaziz Mithat Pasha staged a coup against Abdulaziz. Abdulaziz was taken into custody. It is not certain whether he was killed or he committed suicide. Mithat Pasha starts looking for someone who can perform reforms and end the Tanzimat Era. Murat V becomes the new sultan. Murat V His mental health was not good. Mithat Pasha did not see him as the reformist he wanted so he was able to reign for 93 days. Abdulhamid II became the new sultan. Tanzimat Edict Recited by Mustafa Resit Pasha in Gulhane Park in 1839. First time that a sultan says they are responsible for well-being of all people. The idea is to replace difference with equality. Up until now, the official ideology was sharia. Now the goal is to replace it with a new idea of Ottomanism to deal with seperatist movements. New Laws Reforms in taxation Tax collection process was unfair. Got rid of intermediary people collecting taxes and state started to appoint official tax collectors. Military Conscription Only Muslims were doing military service until that time, and non-Muslims were paying taxes in return of not having to do military service. From now on, everyone will join the army for a certain service time. Judicial Processes Confiscation of property is outlawed. Bribary outlawed. It was very common. Execution without trial is outlawed. Security Guarantee for life, honor and property of all subjects. Responses Muslims did not like the reforms. There was no more sharia. They also believed that the changes were imposed by Western powers. Non-Muslims did not like the reforms either. They did not want to join the army. There were also problems with minorities not accepting being equal with other minorities. Islahat Edict Announced in 1856, Islahat Edict is a more detailed elaboration of the previous reforms. Principle of equality is highlighted more importantly than the Tanzimat Edict. Non-Muslims are invited to form assemblies to reorganize their affairs. Everybody is eligible for official appointment. Non-Muslims had to convert in the past. Non-Muslims are allowed to join civil and military schools. Non-Muslims can pay some money be exempt from military service. (Bedel-i Askeri) Mixed courts are formed. Muslims and non-Muslims can both bring their cases. (Nizamiye) Young Ottomans Founded as a secret society in 1865 by a group of Ottoman individuals, such as Namik Kemal, Sinasi, Ziya Pasha, and Midhat Pasha. They were publishing opposition journals abroad. They came back home in 1871. They were against the Tanzimat Reforms. Political Views They criticisized the Tanzimat as a capitulation to European dictates. They claimed that adoption of European laws had resulted in a tyranny. Economic reforms were irresponsible, lead to the destruction of Ottoman industry and accumulation of debt. They supported a synthesis of Western and Islamic values. A constitution is necessary and a parliament should control the sultan. (constitutional monarchy) They believed in the corrosive effects of power. Seperation of power. (Kuvvetler ayriligi) - Montesquieu They thought that some Islamic doctrines supported similar values with Western contemporary ideas. Commanding right and forbidding wrong. Consultation. (democracy) Their Legacy They inspired future movements in the Islamic world such as Iran. Subsequent generations in the Empire tended to ignore the Islamic content and focused on the patriotic Ottomanism of Namik Kemal.",
