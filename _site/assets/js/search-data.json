    "content": "Abdulhamid II (1876 - 1909) He was made sultan with hopes of maintaining the balance between the imperial court and the Sublime Porte. He suspended tge Ottoman constitution and the parliament after the Ottoman-Russo War of 1877-78. The following era is known as the era of despotism. Personality Basic Elements of the Hamidian Rule Major Reforms of the Hamidian Era The Young Turk Movement The 1908 Revolution 31 March Incident Second Constitutional Period Personality He chose to live in the Yildiz Palace rather than Dolmabahce thinking it was more secure. He appointed Mithat Pasa as the grand vizier. Basic Elements of the Hamidian Rule Back to patrimonialism. The palace gained power again with the abolishment of the parliament and the constitution. Suppressed all forms of opposition. He established a new spy network and started the system of journals: People reporting each other to the government. New traditions were invented: Friday prayers became ceremonial events. Ottoman coat of arms. Title of caliph began to be used for political purposes. He followed a pan-Islamic policy. Aimed to unite all Muslims beyond their nationalities. This was a key part of the foreign policy. Major Reforms of the Hamidian Era Tribal schools were opened. They were schools in Istanbul. Children of important remote tribes were invited. The goal was to create a new type of bond that will encourage solidarity between people of the Empire. It was also hoped that those children would become supporters of the government when they go back home. State infrastucture. New infrastucture was built to provide public services to people. Got along well with other countries as part of the foreign policy. German instructors are hired to educate Ottoman soldiers. German influence grows. Certain words were banned from publication. (burun, tahtakurusu, tepe (Yildiz), saray…) Duyun-u Umumiye (Public Debt Administration) Opened in 1881 as a result of increasing debt. Officers from different countries managed the finances of the Empire. The Young Turk Movement A movement started by students in Ottoman medical academy. Will have great influence in shaping the following years of the Empire. Political ideas influenced from Auguste Comte - Positivism Objective, scientific way of looking at matters. Ludwig Bucher - German materialism Watered down science to understand the world better. Darwinism / Social Darwinism Survival of the fittest. You must show effort to survive. Gustave LeBon - Phenomenon of the Crowd How crowds behave. Elitism. 1889 - Ottoman Union Committee A scattered organization with people living at different places.

Two factions emerge: Ahmed Riza and Prince Sabahaddin Ahmed Riza Prince Sabahaddin Rejects foreign intervention. In favor of working with Britain. Supports maintenance of the centralized approach. In favor of a more decentralized approach, thinking that happiness of people can be increased by giving them more autonomy. In the end, Ahmed Riza’s faction gains the upper hand. The 1908 Revolution Road to the Revolution Soldiers freshly out of college were sent to Macedonia to deal with a local resurgion. They see that Abdulhamid is not able to control the situatio, and that loyalty is more important than merit. People close to the sultan are promoted more faster. Civilians are unhappy as well. In 1906, Talat bey establishes the Ottoman Freedom Society, to join the CUP later on. CUP members decide they need a strong ally to overthrow the sultan. So they start forming an alliance with the army, who already contains many unhappy soldiers. CUP starts recruiting members from the army. Rumors about an Anglo-Russian alliance about reforms in Macedonia causes them to take action. Two people need mentioning: Resneli Niyazi: He started a rebellion with 200 people. They started bombarding the Yildiz Palace with telegrams. Enver Bey: He helped convert army officers into gang members. In 1908 Abdulhamid issued a decree for convening of a new chamber of deputies. Political Vision of the Revolution Liberty, equality, fraternity, and justice. They support a constitutional monarchy based on the rule of law around a meritocratic parliamentary democracy. Design a new Ottoman identity united against European interventions. Free press and individual liberties. Elections are held in 1908. CUP members do not come to Istanbul right away. They stay in Thessaloniki but continue the reformist agenda. 31 March Incident In 1909, all the groups against CUP’s reforms rebelled, including Abdulhamid supporters, socialists etc. CUP created an army marching to the Ottoman capital (action army). The army is led by Mahmut Sevket Pasa. They suppress the rebellion. After the incident, Abdulhamid is deposed and sent to Thessaloniki. Mehmet Resat becomes the new sultan. CUP Measures After the Incident Martial law. Strikes are banned. Labor unions are dissolved. Freedom of press is restricted. Second Constitutional Period Power struggle for CUP continues. Freedom and Accord Party is founded in 1911 against the CUP in the parliament. The country is in constant battles until 1922: 1911 - War in Tripoli Tripoli was the last African territory left. Troops were organized against an Italian invasion. 1912-13 Balkan Wars Serbs, Greeks, and Bulgarians joined forces and declared war on Ottomans. Ottomans lost the first war and retreated back to Edirne. Ottomans recaptured Edirnce when the Balkan nations were fighting against each other over territory claims. Turkish nationalism gained momentum. 1913 - Bab-i Ali Coup CUP gained all the power in the government. Single party rule of CUP begins. Led by: Cemal Pasha Enver Pasha Talat Pasha",

    "content": "1960 Coup Amid growing discontent and protests, Alparslan Turkes announced on 27th May, 1960 that the arme forces were taking over the government. The brutal period ended with 4 executions, including Adnan Menderes. National Unity Committe 1961 Constitution Election Law Trial of the Old Regime There was discontent and protests against the government. US aid from the Truman Doctrine and the Marshall plan was running out. On May 27, 1960, Alparslan Turkes announced on radio that the armed forces were taking over the government. People who carried the coup were low-ranking soldiers. Top soldiers in the army did not know about the coup. They proposed close alliances with NATO and the US. American involvement in the coup is argued. Army officials had a Western education aligned with NATO values. National Unity Committee Army officials formed the National Unity Committee (Milli Birlik Komitesi) headed by Cemal Gursel. It contained 38 officers. Cemal Gursel was a senior soldier with no involvement leading to the coup. He was brought to Ankara from Izmir. He is chosen the PM, and minister of defence. This gives the message that this is not simply a change of government. A law professor (Siddik Sami Onar) prepared a report justifying the acts of the army. There are two factions in the NUC: People like Cemal Gursel propose to create a plan and transfer the power back to the people. Alparslan Turkes’ group says they cannot trust civilians. Menderes and others should learn their lesson. On November 13, 1960, Cemal Gursel announces that NUC was disbanded and a new committe was founded. 14 radicals, including Alparlan Turkes’ group, were excluded. They were sent to various countries as military ateches. (Turkes -&gt; India) 1961 Constitution Siddik Sami Onar and his friends developed a new constitution. It stayed in effect from 1961 to 1980. It was progressive compared to the 1982 constitution. The 1924 constitution had a specific agenda. It provided what was needed to perform reforms. No seperation of powers. The main aim of the new constitution was to prevent the occurence of a power monopoly such as DP, or CHP by counter-balancing the parliament with other institutions. Seperation of powers should be clearly established. Powers of executives should be limited. They took some measures to make legislation more difficult A new senate was created. All legislation had to pass through both chambers. Parliament could overrule a senate veto with 2/3 majority. Legislation became more time-consuming as a result. All MGK members became members of the senate. 1/3 was elected with elections. 1/3 was selected by the president. A constitutional court was formed. It could stop any legislation it deemed unconstitutional. The universities and the mass media were given full autonomy. Bill of civil liberties was introduced. Military was given a constitutional role for the first time with the introduction of the MGK. Civilian and military officials were together. It is led by the president. Military wanted to take a role in politics as they did not trust civilians. Election Law The election law was changed as well. Proportional representation was introduced to lessen the chance of one party gaining large majority such as DP. Everyone is represented according to their votes. Trial of the Old Regime Democrats were arrested right after the coup and taken to Yassiada. The party was closed. Judges made no effort to hide their distaste. They were rude against the accused. Namik Gedik, minister of the interior, committed suicide. People over 65 were not executed. 4 people were sentenced to death: Adnan Menderes Hasan Polatkan Celal Bayar (not executed) Fatin Rustu Zorlu",

Economic Boom Reversal of Fortune after 1954 1954 Elections 6-7 September Events 1957 Elections Final Years of Menderes Elements of the single-party era are gradually shut down. Village institutions Ezan back to Arabic Property of CHP confiscated in 1952 Marked by tense relationships between two parties. Opt-out Religion Classes. Everyone should take the religion class. Those who don’t want should write a petition to opt-out. That created public pressure for those who don’t want to take the class. Ataturk Protection Law. Enacted to deal with organized attacks against Ataturk statues. (Ticaniler Cemaati) Economic Boom High economic growth between 1950-54. Democrats, being supporters of a free market, implemented liberalization policies. Close relations with the US. They provided financial aid and credits were used to buy machinery. Interests of the farmer put first for the first time. Mechanization in agriculture is increased. The year 1953 brings the best harvest of history. High amounts of investment in construction industry and road networks. They had thought that planning == communism. So policies were mostly followed without a solid plan. Paid workers in cities felt themselves alienated with more support given to farmers and rural workers. Reversal of Fortune after 1954 Shit hits the fan after 1954. Trade deficit is increasing. Growth falls from 13% to 4$, lira is devaluated, debts rescheduled, prices raised. By 1960, total debt is ~$1.5B 25% of GNP. Turkey will have to deal with IMF packages that also bring necessary policies with them: Devalue money Stop subsidies … They were eager to get quick results rather than long-term benefits. 1954 Elections DP increases their majority in the parliament. DP’s Growing Authoritarianism To eliminate Inonu’s people from the state, they pass a law saying that people who worked for the state for more than 25 years are retired. The right to prove: Journalists were not allowed to write about speculations investigating politicians. Some people want to give increased rights to journalists so that those people can be exposed. Menderes doesn’t want that. 14 people form a new party. 6-7 September Events In the morning of September 6th, the newspaper Istanbul Express writes that Ataturk’s house in Thessaloniki was bombed and raided by Greeks. There actually was a bomb but it was not that big of a deal. There was also tension regarding the Cyprus situation at the same time. Someone inside a secret state agency had paid the newspaper for the article. People came from peripheral areas of Istanbul with trucks and launched attacks on non-Muslim neighbors (Beyoglu, Kadikoy…). 11 dead and 300 injured. It was an organized event but DP’s involvement is uncertain. 10% of the damage was compensated by the state, and some ministers resigned. 1957 Elections DP is still popular amongst people, but the opposition parties are forming an alliance. Menderes changes the election law, making it impossible for other parties to join the elections together. Result: DP lost some seats. CHP gained seats. DP still majority. Support among intellectuals, youth, members of the bureucracy and armed forces to DP crumbles. Freedom of press is tightened and autonomy of universities decreased. Final Years of Menderes There is a growing discontent inside the military against Menderes. Some conspiracies unfold but they are not investigated much by Menderes. He uses them as political arguments. He later realizes that his support is declining. He launches the Vatan Cephesi (Fatherland Front). It was a way to mobilize his support base. People joining the front were announced on the radio every day. Some people create another organization called Radyo Dinlemeyi Reddedenler Cemiyeti. After some time, he started to seriously investigate those claims. Invsetigatory Committee (Tahkikat Komisyonu) founded in April 1960. Members of the commitee were DP members. Major protests in Kizilay in May with ~550K people.",

He starts organizing meetings attended by lots of former CUP members. Amasya Circular (21-22 June): Decided upon that sultan is unable to control the situation. Erzurum Congress (23 July): Mustafa Kemal resigned from his official duty. Sivas Congress (4-11 Sept.): Mustafa Kemal started preparing a document that will be the roadmap for the national struggle (Misak-i Milli). The langauge is deliberately kept vague. Misak-i Milli Territories inhabiited by an Ottoman Muslim majority form an indivisible whole united in religion, race, and aim. Plebiscite (referendum) for decisions on certain areas such as the Arab provinces, Kars, Ardahan and Batum. Economic independence. Since this document should have some official recognition to make people believe in it, Mustafa Kemal sends it to the Ottoman assembly in Istanbul. Deputies show their support and share it with the public. Important intellectuals who can shape public opinion are sent to Malta after the British request. The British invade Istanbul and shut down the parliament. Tekalif-i Milliye A set of decisions announced to gain support for the military. Pepople give 10% of their belongings to the army for support. Istiklal Mahkemeleri Courts opened to deal with army deserters. There is no chance to appeal. Executed. Political Course The movement focuses more an Islam rather than nationalism. They want to create a religios solidarity. Progress of the War As the war progressed, those fighting for the other side started to question their involvement in the war. Greek government that joined the war was overthrown. Britain had its own problems with Ireland. France had problems with its mandate regimes in the Middle East. Italy was unhappy with the role of Greeks. Soviets supported the Ankara government. Dumlupinar (30 August 1922): Victory Day Lausanne Conference Lasted 8 months in two rounds during 1922-23. They invited delegates from both governments. This made the Ankara government angry. As a result, sultanate was abolished in November 1, 1922. The Ottoman dynasty left the country with 150 people. The delegation was led by Ismet Inonu. Treaty Goals of the national pact were achieved to a large extent. Political and economical independence of the new state recognized. Mosul stayed in Iraq under British rule. Sancak of Alexandrette (Hatay) remained with French Syria. Aegean Islands remained with Greece and Italy. Anatolian and Eastern Thrace became part of the new state. No mention of Armenia or Kurdistan. Straits internationalized and demilitarized. Controlled by a commission led by Turkish official. Capitulations remained abolished. Turkey still had to honour all existing foreign conessions and it was not free to change its rules until 1929. Ottoman debt was paid until 1954. Turkey will protect its citizens regardless of race, language etc. Minorities are defined according to their religions. Kurds weren’t classified as a minority. Population exchange between Turkey and Greece, was the largest one until that point in history. As a result Turkey lost a significant group critical in terms of knowledge.",

Personality Sened-i Ittifak Reforms Vaka-i Hayriye Personality People called him the gavur(infidel) sultan because of the stubborn, single-minded nature of his reforms without and regard for public demands. He understood the importance of a self-image (as with many rulers after the French Revolution) and wanted to expose himself to his people. He put his portrait in state offfices. Sened-i Ittifak Mahmud thought that he had to come to term with local notables to perform his reforms even though it was unusual for a sultan to do so. He signed an agreement with them in 1808. The empire became more centralized as a result. Even though he signed the document, he never ratified it. This shows his reservations about the agreement. He will still do anything to get rid of local notables. Reforms He performed reforms in many different areas. He increased the number of people working for the state. Created the first postal service, and planned projects for expanding the road network. The first census was performed. To gather information and see who was eligible for military service. Women were not included in the census. The first official newspaper was published. Cofeehouses became important places for sharing of ideas. Sultans sent spies to coffeehouses to gather information. He opened the translation office. Opened a medical school. In those times, a good education meant either religious or military education. Medical school provided a new, more scientific method of learning more in tune with the rest of the world. Small exchange programs to send students abroad. In an expedition to Morocco, he saw and decided to adopt fez, thinking that it unifies people under one view. This caused a lot of criticism. The first fez factory was created in Feshane. Vaka-i Hayriye Mahmud invited janissaries to an event in a square, in 1828. Turns out if was a trap and janissaries were attacked from all angles once they entered the square. This practically destroyed janissaries. He created a new army, called Victorious Army of Muhammad.",

It was not a widely discussed idea. People’s Party Called the Republican People’s Party later on. Issues like giving too much power to one man started to be considered more with the first few years bringing a struggle for power. Caliphate The title of caliph was not abolished with the sultanate. Abdulmecit Efendi was the last caliph. He was a religioud scholar and a respected man. He supported Mustafa Kemal. Mustafa Kemal was disturbed with the idea of another authority figure. Caliphate was abolished in 1924. New Constitution The new constitution of 1924 focused on unity of powers rather than seperation. The first opposition party was created. (Progressive Republican Party) They were Mustafa Kemal’s old friends. More liberal economically, respective towards religion, and the criticisized the authoriarian practices of CHP. Gained a strong following. Sheikh Sait Rebellion Sait was a tribal leader in SE Anatolia. He revolted in 1925 motivated by religious motives and Kurdish nationalism. Could not be successful because of the Alevi-Sunni division among Kurds. Against the abolishment of caliphate. A new Kurdish state was promised in Sevres. Martial law was announced after the suppression of the revolt. Takrir-i Sukun Government can shut down any written source at wish. Gave the government extensive power for 2 years. Istiklal courts opened. Opposition including the new party are silenced. Assasination Attempt A former deputy named Ziya Hursit and other people connected to CUP plotted an assasination against M. Kemal. They were supposed to attack from a barber shop and then flee to Greece. Their aide Giritli Sevki wrote a letter to Ismet Inonu disclosing the plans. The government started a crackdown on former CUP members that extended beyond the assasination. People like Kazim Karabekir and Ali Fuat Cebesoy were arrested. Economics in the New Republic The country was in a very bad spot economically. Izmir Economic Congress (1923) People with influence on local monetary issues gathered in Izmir to discuss the economic future of the country. Asar tax was eliminated. It was a 10% tax on agricultural products. Decided it will take a long time to recover from the departure of Greeks and Armenians who mostly were merchants. A new Muslim merchant class should be created. Turkey will be a capitalist state, but it will be the major driving force behind new investments. Also not opposing foreign investment as local people are not strong enough. This model is called the mixed model. Tesvik-i Sanayi Law (1927) Aimed at promoting industrialization. Will not be very successful because the economic actors are very weak. Great Depression (1929) The depression that started in the US also affected the rest of the world and the new Turkey. Statism (1930 and onwards) Industrial development and most of the economic activities will be run by the state. 5-year development pland starting with 1934. Railways are a major area of investment. Agrarian production was also decreased after the crisis. Free Republican Party Mustafa Kemal saw that some people were unhappy with economic conditions and wanted their voice to be heard. He asked his cloes friend Fethi Okyar to create a new opposition party to relive the tension. Okyar had one concern: He wanted to make sure that M. Kemal would remain impartial to this new party and his own party CHP. As a sign of confidence M. Kemal’s sister Makbule signed up for the new party. The main goal was that the new party won’t be harsh in its opposition. However, they accumulated a large support specifically on the Aegean side and won 30 seats in the 1930 election. Adnan Menderes was also a member. On a trip to Izmir, the governor did not let Okyar give his speech for security concerns. Okyar realized that he will one way or another clash with M. Kemal if he stays as the head of the party. The party was abolished in December 1930, four months after its creation. Menemen Incident People requesting sharia and the caliphate back revolted in Menemen. A teacher on military service, Kubilay, was killed in the fights and his head was put on a spike. Reinforcements were sent to the region to deal with the situation. Protesters were executed.",

Post-Coup 1961 Elections Talat Aydemir Political Parties Growth of Political Radicalism on the Right Post-Coup There was a referendum on the new constitution. Accepted with 62%. People were unhappy with what was done to DP. Some were dissappointed against the military. Parliamentary elections were held in October 15, 1961. New parties were founded before the elections. Adalet Partisi: Founded by Ragip Gumuspala, a retired high-ranking officer. Suited for the role in the eyes of the military and civilians. Becomes the major right-wing party after the end of DP. Cumhuriyetci Koylu Millet Partisi: Osman Bolukbasi founded CKMP. Yeni Turkiye Partisi: Not that strong. Turkiye Isci Partisi: Did not take part in elections. First party in Turkish history to define itself in ideological ways. All parties signed a document with the army stating that they will not criticise the coup as a part of their campaign. 1961 Elections CHP (37%) and AP (35%) get majority of the votes and form a coalition. (first coalition government) Ismet Inonu becomes the PM. The coalition won’t last long. It falls apart 6 months later as AP was supporting a general amnesty for ex-DP members. CHP formed a coalition with YTP and CKMP. Inonu resigns after budget meetings in 1965. A temporary government is formed. The period between 1960-65 was a transitional period in Turkish politics. Right-wing politicians were careful not to upset the military. There were also problems inside the military. Talat Aydemir He was an officer in the army. He was rejected from the NUC, and he thinks that military should run the country forever and that civilians cannot be trusted. He gathered many enemies and doesn’t have good relations with Inonu. He attempts two coups in 1962 (sieged Inonu’s office, but let him go), and again 10 months later but fails. He was warned after the first one, but 1,500 people were put to trial. Later, he was executed with Fetih Gurcan. Political Parties Adalet Partisi The founder Ragip Gumuspala died of a heart attack and a fight for leadership begins in the party. Suleyman Demirel is elected against Saadettin Bilgic as the new leader of the party. Bilgic is a more controversial figure. Demirel has a different background compared to other politicians. He is an engineer with a rural background, used to work for DSI. There is a pluralistic environment in the 60’s. Politics revolve around ideologies. Leftist ideas are on the rise like other places of the world. Turkiye Isci Partisi Created in 1961 by members of the labor unions. They invited intellectuals and lawyers to the party. Mehmet Ali Aybar becomes the leader of the party. Despite having low votes, they affect other politicians’ politics as well. CHP They joined the ‘65 elections with a new manifesto =&gt; left of center. They aim at a new electoral base with many people migrating to cities from rural areas. They are also competing with TIP. Growth of Political Radicalism on the Right Alparslan Turkes becomes the leader of the ulkucu movement. (grey wolves) He has his own manifesto rejecting capitalism and liberalism. He joins Osman Bolukbasi’s party. Grey wolves began campaigns to intimidate leftist students. Their acts are mostly reactive. They don’t gain a strong support base. Necmettin Erbakan joins the parliament independently in 1965 and later forms his own party. Erbakan, Demirel, Ecevit, Turkes are major figures of the Turkish political scene between 1965-80.",

He was eventually dethroned and imprisoned by the Janissaries. His cousin Mustafa IV became the new sultan. Personality State of the Empire Reforms Nizam-i Cedit Janissaries Kabakci Mustafa Personality Selim was a well-educated, modernist sultan. He had a cautious personality. Did not want to cause problems with reforms considering the state of the Empire. State of the Empire When Selim became the sultan, the Empire was not in good shape. There was an economic crisis and protests against tax rates. There were nationalistic rebellions emerging in the Balkans. Reforms Opened new engineering schools. Opened new embassies in major European capitals. Before then, it was thought that not opening embassies in other countries showed the superiority of Ottomans as opening an embassy meant recognizing the other country. Selim was aware of the importance of democratic relations with other countries. Nizam-i Cedit (New Order) Selim created a new army called Nizam-i Cedit based on Western principles. It was the first of its kind in Ottoman history. Janissaries refused to join the new army, but the army became successful. They beat Napoleon’s army in Egypt. Selim also invited French instructors to train new soldiers. This also is a key indicator of good French-Ottoman relations. Janissaries Janissaries played a key role in the Ottoman army. They were meant to be loyal servants to the sultan. They were supposed to be a part of the military alone. It was forbidden for them to marry and have children. However, after Selim’s military reforms such as the new army, they started vocally protesting. They started to get married, have children, and get involved with trade. Janissaries became a part of society, not the state. These were alarming developments for the sultan. Kabakci Mustafa In the year 1807, Kabakci Mustafa led the Janissaries to a rebellion against the sultan. Selim was forced the disband the new army, and step down as the sultan.

    "title": "Tanzimat Era",
    "content": "Tanzimat Era Tanzimat (to regulate) Era is an era of reforms. Through the Tanzimat and Islahat edicts, power shifted from the sultan to bureucracy. The sultans of this era Abdulmecit and Abdulaziz were not so effective. Bureucrats such as Ali Pasha, Fuat Pasha, and Mustafa Resit Pasa stand out. Reforms Sultans Tanzimat Edict Islahat Edict Young Ottomans Reforms Reasons The main reason behind the reforms was the thereatening aspect of emerging global modernity. Problems There were 3 main problems with the reforms: They created a duality. New rules were not completely able to replace old traditions. Their top-down nature contradicted with the values they were supporting. Reforms came directly from the top without much regard for public opinion. Reactions. Neither Muslims nor non-Muslims were happy with the reforms. Legacy The reforms reinforced duality in almost all areas of life. The idea of Ottomanism did not have much effect on non-Muslim people. Contradiction of bureucratuc centralization and political fragmentation. Majalla: A combination of French penal code and court decisions made by kadis. Written by Ahmet Cevdet Pasha. Clashes New Old Civil courts Sharia courts Modern universities Old medresses An academy of modern sciences Ulema gatherings European theater Traditional shadow puppet show The novel Divan poetry Sultans Abdulaziz Mithat Pasha staged a coup against Abdulaziz. Abdulaziz was taken into custody. It is not certain whether he was killed or he committed suicide. Mithat Pasha starts looking for someone who can perform reforms and end the Tanzimat Era. Murat V becomes the new sultan. Murat V His mental health was not good. Mithat Pasha did not see him as the reformist he wanted so he was able to reign for 93 days. Abdulhamid II became the new sultan. Tanzimat Edict Recited by Mustafa Resit Pasha in Gulhane Park in 1839. First time that a sultan says they are responsible for well-being of all people. The idea is to replace difference with equality. Up until now, the official ideology was sharia. Now the goal is to replace it with a new idea of Ottomanism to deal with seperatist movements. New Laws Reforms in taxation Tax collection process was unfair. Got rid of intermediary people collecting taxes and state started to appoint official tax collectors. Military Conscription Only Muslims were doing military service until that time, and non-Muslims were paying taxes in return of not having to do military service. From now on, everyone will join the army for a certain service time. Judicial Processes Confiscation of property is outlawed. Bribary outlawed. It was very common. Execution without trial is outlawed. Security Guarantee for life, honor and property of all subjects. Responses Muslims did not like the reforms. There was no more sharia. They also believed that the changes were imposed by Western powers. Non-Muslims did not like the reforms either. They did not want to join the army. There were also problems with minorities not accepting being equal with other minorities. Islahat Edict Announced in 1856, Islahat Edict is a more detailed elaboration of the previous reforms. Principle of equality is highlighted more importantly than the Tanzimat Edict. Non-Muslims are invited to form assemblies to reorganize their affairs. Everybody is eligible for official appointment. Non-Muslims had to convert in the past. Non-Muslims are allowed to join civil and military schools. Non-Muslims can pay some money be exempt from military service. (Bedel-i Askeri) Mixed courts are formed. Muslims and non-Muslims can both bring their cases. (Nizamiye) Young Ottomans Founded as a secret society in 1865 by a group of Ottoman individuals, such as Namik Kemal, Sinasi, Ziya Pasha, and Midhat Pasha. They were publishing opposition journals abroad. They came back home in 1871. They were against the Tanzimat Reforms. Political Views They criticisized the Tanzimat as a capitulation to European dictates. They claimed that adoption of European laws had resulted in a tyranny. Economic reforms were irresponsible, lead to the destruction of Ottoman industry and accumulation of debt. They supported a synthesis of Western and Islamic values. A constitution is necessary and a parliament should control the sultan. (constitutional monarchy) They believed in the corrosive effects of power. Seperation of power. (Kuvvetler ayriligi) - Montesquieu They thought that some Islamic doctrines supported similar values with Western contemporary ideas. Commanding right and forbidding wrong. Consultation. (democracy) Their Legacy They inspired future movements in the Islamic world such as Iran. Subsequent generations in the Empire tended to ignore the Islamic content and focused on the patriotic Ottomanism of Namik Kemal.",

    "content": "Turkey and the Second World War The period between 1945 and 1950. The rise of democrats happens in this period with the beginning of the multi-party system. Memorandum of the Four Democratic Party CHP Congress 1946 Elections 12th July Declaration 1950 Elections Inonu tries to change his owm and CHP’s image after the tough WWII period. National Defense Law and Wealth Tax were introduced during the war. Memorandum of the Four Adnan Menderes, Celal Bayar, Fuat Koprulu and Refik Koraltan submitted a memorandum to the parliament. They criticisized the Land Distribution Law. Democratic Party Nuri Demirag had create the first opposition party (Milli Kalkinma Partisi) in 1945 but he is not that successful. Democratic Party was registered in 1946 after they were gradually expelled from CHP. They are different from CHP in some ways: Parties like CHP are known as ‘kadro partisi’ where a certain principles are followed with certain ideologies. Parties like DP are more relaxed. Instead of focusing on a single ideology, they aim to catch as many people as possible (kitle partisi). They are more pragmatic. CHP Congress CHP held an extra-ordinary congress in 1946 that resulted in some important decisions: Inonu will get rid of all his titles. Inonu resigns from his duty. He is elected the president again through an election. He is no longer the eternal leader. The press law was liberalized. Universities are given a certain degree of autonomy. Elections become direct elections. Elections of 1947 were brought forward a year to catch the Democrats unprepared. 1946 Elections They are nicknamed the ‘hileli secim’. Votes are given openly, counting is done in secret. Democrats, thinking this was unacceptable, spoke with Inonu after the election and voiced their concerns. Celal Bayar asks Inonu to make a statement legitimizing the opposition. 12th July Declaration A statement was declared in 1947 stating both parties are parties of this country and are legitimate. People are free to choose whatever they want. Hardliners inside CHP such as Recep Peker were eliminated. At its 1947 congress, CHP moved closer to the DP programme with two exceptions: Even though CHP started considering a free market as well, they are still reserved towards things like privitization. The right to strike is not given. DP proposed they would provide it, but they didn’t. Inonu starts adopting a more relaxed approach to things like secularism to fix their image. In 1948, the first Faculty of Divinity opens in Ankara as well as Imam Hatip Schools. 1950 Elections Free and fair elections with a turnout rate of 80%. Everything is based on the idea of majority. Winner in a city takes all the MP seats. DP’s main slogan is “Yeter soz milletin!”. DP win with 53.4% against CHP’s 39.8%. Results in 408 seats against 69. CHP did not win a single province in the Western part of the country. After the election, some army officers approached Inonu and proposed they could nullify the elections and he could remain the leader. He rejected the offer. DP people are still concerned about Inonu because of his charisma and power (pasa faktoru). There will be various moments in the following decade that the relationship between Inonu and Menderes gets tense.",

    "content": "World War 1 (1914 - 1918) Before the War End of the War Before the War The war was inevitable after the Balkan Wars. Matters were heated. Ottomans knew they could not survive without the support of a great power. They start negotiating with different countries, but side with Germany in the end. Why did Ottomans side with Germany? They did not want to be isolated during the war. Germans didn’t have that much of a territorial desire over Ottoman lands, unlike other countries. People thought the war would only be with Russia (neighbors). They underestimated the scale of the war. Why did Germans side with Ottomans? Germans hoped that the caliph could use his religious power to make Muslims declare jihad against the English in their colonies. They could increase the number of fronts and distract the enemies. They gained control of the straits. Controlling the routes to colonies of other great powers was important. Ottomans officially entered the war after German ships Goeben and Breslau bombed Russian ports with Ottoman flags. Ottomans faught on three fronts: Caucasus Gallipoli Arabian fronts End of the War Mehmet VI (Vahdettin) became the new sultan. There was a power vacuum in Istanbul.
