    "content": "Abdulhamid II (1876 - 1909) He was made sultan with hopes of maintaining the balance between the imperial court and the Sublime Porte. He suspended tge Ottoman constitution and the parliament after the Ottoman-Russo War of 1877-78. The following era is known as the era of despotism. Personality Basic Elements of the Hamidian Rule Major Reforms of the Hamidian Era The Young Turk Movement The 1908 Revolution 31 March Incident Second Constitutional Period Personality He chose to live in the Yildiz Palace rather than Dolmabahce thinking it was more secure. He appointed Mithat Pasa as the grand vizier. Basic Elements of the Hamidian Rule Back to patrimonialism. The palace gained power again with the abolishment of the parliament and the constitution. Suppressed all forms of opposition. He established a new spy network and started the system of journals: People reporting each other to the government. New traditions were invented: Friday prayers became ceremonial events. Ottoman coat of arms. Title of caliph began to be used for political purposes. He followed a pan-Islamic policy. Aimed to unite all Muslims beyond their nationalities. This was a key part of the foreign policy. Major Reforms of the Hamidian Era Tribal schools were opened. They were schools in Istanbul. Children of important remote tribes were invited. The goal was to create a new type of bond that will encourage solidarity between people of the Empire. It was also hoped that those children would become supporters of the government when they go back home. State infrastucture. New infrastucture was built to provide public services to people. Got along well with other countries as part of the foreign policy. German instructors are hired to educate Ottoman soldiers. German influence grows. Certain words were banned from publication. (burun, tahtakurusu, tepe (Yildiz), saray…) Duyun-u Umumiye (Public Debt Administration) Opened in 1881 as a result of increasing debt. Officers from different countries managed the finances of the Empire. The Young Turk Movement A movement started by students in Ottoman medical academy. Will have great influence in shaping the following years of the Empire. Political ideas influenced from Auguste Comte - Positivism Objective, scientific way of looking at matters. Ludwig Bucher - German materialism Watered down science to understand the world better. Darwinism / Social Darwinism Survival of the fittest. You must show effort to survive. Gustave LeBon - Phenomenon of the Crowd How crowds behave. Elitism. 1889 - Ottoman Union Committee A scattered organization with people living at different places.

Two factions emerge: Ahmed Riza and Prince Sabahaddin Ahmed Riza Prince Sabahaddin Rejects foreign intervention. In favor of working with Britain. Supports maintenance of the centralized approach. In favor of a more decentralized approach, thinking that happiness of people can be increased by giving them more autonomy. In the end, Ahmed Riza’s faction gains the upper hand. The 1908 Revolution Road to the Revolution Soldiers freshly out of college were sent to Macedonia to deal with a local resurgion. They see that Abdulhamid is not able to control the situatio, and that loyalty is more important than merit. People close to the sultan are promoted more faster. Civilians are unhappy as well. In 1906, Talat bey establishes the Ottoman Freedom Society, to join the CUP later on. CUP members decide they need a strong ally to overthrow the sultan. So they start forming an alliance with the army, who already contains many unhappy soldiers. CUP starts recruiting members from the army. Rumors about an Anglo-Russian alliance about reforms in Macedonia causes them to take action. Two people need mentioning: Resneli Niyazi: He started a rebellion with 200 people. They started bombarding the Yildiz Palace with telegrams. Enver Bey: He helped convert army officers into gang members. In 1908 Abdulhamid issued a decree for convening of a new chamber of deputies. Political Vision of the Revolution Liberty, equality, fraternity, and justice. They support a constitutional monarchy based on the rule of law around a meritocratic parliamentary democracy. Design a new Ottoman identity united against European interventions. Free press and individual liberties. Elections are held in 1908. CUP members do not come to Istanbul right away. They stay in Thessaloniki but continue the reformist agenda. 31 March Incident In 1909, all the groups against CUP’s reforms rebelled, including Abdulhamid supporters, socialists etc. CUP created an army marching to the Ottoman capital (action army). The army is led by Mahmut Sevket Pasa. They suppress the rebellion. After the incident, Abdulhamid is deposed and sent to Thessaloniki. Mehmet Resat becomes the new sultan. CUP Measures After the Incident Martial law. Strikes are banned. Labor unions are dissolved. Freedom of press is restricted. Second Constitutional Period Power struggle for CUP continues. Freedom and Accord Party is founded in 1911 against the CUP in the parliament. The country is in constant battles until 1922: 1911 - War in Tripoli Tripoli was the last African territory left. Troops were organized against an Italian invasion. 1912-13 Balkan Wars Serbs, Greeks, and Bulgarians joined forces and declared war on Ottomans. Ottomans lost the first war and retreated back to Edirne. Ottomans recaptured Edirnce when the Balkan nations were fighting against each other over territory claims. Turkish nationalism gained momentum. 1913 - Bab-i Ali Coup CUP gained all the power in the government. Single party rule of CUP begins. Led by: Cemal Pasha Enver Pasha Talat Pasha",

    "content": "The War of Independence (1919) Misak-i Milli Tekalif-i Milliye Istiklal Mahkemeleri Political Course Progress of the War Lausenne Conference The starting date for the War of Independence is officially when Mustafa Kemal is sent to Samsun to deal with local issues. He starts organizing meetings attended by lots of former CUP members. Amasya Circular (21-22 June): Decided upon that sultan is unable to control the situation. Erzurum Congress (23 July): Mustafa Kemal resigned from his official duty. Sivas Congress (4-11 Sept.): Mustafa Kemal started preparing a document that will be the roadmap for the national struggle (Misak-i Milli). The langauge is deliberately kept vague. Misak-i Milli Territories inhabiited by an Ottoman Muslim majority form an indivisible whole united in religion, race, and aim. Plebiscite (referendum) for decisions on certain areas such as the Arab provinces, Kars, Ardahan and Batum. Economic independence. Since this document should have some official recognition to make people believe in it, Mustafa Kemal sends it to the Ottoman assembly in Istanbul. Deputies show their support and share it with the public. Important intellectuals who can shape public opinion are sent to Malta after the British request. The British invade Istanbul and shut down the parliament. Tekalif-i Milliye A set of decisions announced to gain support for the military. Pepople give 10% of their belongings to the army for support. Istiklal Mahkemeleri Courts opened to deal with army deserters. There is no chance to appeal. Executed. Political Course The movement focuses more an Islam rather than nationalism. They want to create a religios solidarity. Progress of the War As the war progressed, those fighting for the other side started to question their involvement in the war. Greek government that joined the war was overthrown. Britain had its own problems with Ireland. France had problems with its mandate regimes in the Middle East. Italy was unhappy with the role of Greeks. Soviets supported the Ankara government. Dumlupinar (30 August 1922): Victory Day Lausanne Conference Lasted 8 months in two rounds during 1922-23. They invited delegates from both governments. This made the Ankara government angry. As a result, sultanate was abolished in November 1, 1922. The Ottoman dynasty left the country with 150 people. The delegation was led by Ismet Inonu. Treaty Goals of the national pact were achieved to a large extent. Political and economical independence of the new state recognized. Mosul stayed in Iraq under British rule. Sancak of Alexandrette (Hatay) remained with French Syria. Aegean Islands remained with Greece and Italy. Anatolian and Eastern Thrace became part of the new state. No mention of Armenia or Kurdistan. Straits internationalized and demilitarized. Controlled by a commission led by Turkish official. Capitulations remained abolished. Turkey still had to honour all existing foreign conessions and it was not free to change its rules until 1929. Ottoman debt was paid until 1954. Turkey will protect its citizens regardless of race, language etc. Minorities are defined according to their religions. Kurds weren’t classified as a minority. Population exchange between Turkey and Greece, was the largest one until that point in history. As a result Turkey lost a significant group critical in terms of knowledge.",

    "content": "Mahmud II (1808 - 1838) Mahmud II replaced his brother Mustafa as the sultan. He made wide-ranging reforms following in the footsteps of Selim. Personality Sened-i Ittifak Reforms Vaka-i Hayriye Personality People called him the gavur(infidel) sultan because of the stubborn, single-minded nature of his reforms without and regard for public demands. He understood the importance of a self-image (as with many rulers after the French Revolution) and wanted to expose himself to his people. He put his portrait in state offfices. Sened-i Ittifak Mahmud thought that he had to come to term with local notables to perform his reforms even though it was unusual for a sultan to do so. He signed an agreement with them in 1808. The empire became more centralized as a result. Even though he signed the document, he never ratified it. This shows his reservations about the agreement. He will still do anything to get rid of local notables. Reforms He performed reforms in many different areas. He increased the number of people working for the state. Created the first postal service, and planned projects for expanding the road network. The first census was performed. To gather information and see who was eligible for military service. Women were not included in the census. The first official newspaper was published. Cofeehouses became important places for sharing of ideas. Sultans sent spies to coffeehouses to gather information. He opened the translation office. Opened a medical school. In those times, a good education meant either religious or military education. Medical school provided a new, more scientific method of learning more in tune with the rest of the world. Small exchange programs to send students abroad. In an expedition to Morocco, he saw and decided to adopt fez, thinking that it unifies people under one view. This caused a lot of criticism. The first fez factory was created in Feshane. Vaka-i Hayriye Mahmud invited janissaries to an event in a square, in 1828. Turns out if was a trap and janissaries were attacked from all angles once they entered the square. This practically destroyed janissaries. He created a new army, called Victorious Army of Muhammad.",

Rise to Power Alemdar Mustafa Pasha Rise to Power Mustafa became the new sultan after Selim left the throne in an eventful manner. With his reign, Janissaries (whom he got along well with) started finding and murdering people who supported Selim and his reforms. Alemdar Mustafa Pasha Alemdar was a reformist commander, supporting Selim. After Selim’s fall, he brought his army from Bulgaria to Istanbul to bring Selim back but Selim was already executed. They fought against the rebels led by Kabakci Mustafa and suppressed them. They took control. When Mustafa IV learend of these events, he ordered Selim and Mahmud to be killed and Selim’s body was shown to Alemdar’s people. Afterwards, they dethroned Mustafa and Mahmud, who managed to overcome the hitmen sent by his brother, became the new sultan. Therefore, Mustafa’s efforts to rollback Selim’s reforms failed. His successor Mahmud was also a reformist.",

    "content": "Selim III (1789 - 1807) Took the throne in 1789. He was a reformist. Opened new schools, embassies, and created a new army. He was eventually dethroned and imprisoned by the Janissaries. His cousin Mustafa IV became the new sultan. Personality State of the Empire Reforms Nizam-i Cedit Janissaries Kabakci Mustafa Personality Selim was a well-educated, modernist sultan. He had a cautious personality. Did not want to cause problems with reforms considering the state of the Empire. State of the Empire When Selim became the sultan, the Empire was not in good shape. There was an economic crisis and protests against tax rates. There were nationalistic rebellions emerging in the Balkans. Reforms Opened new engineering schools. Opened new embassies in major European capitals. Before then, it was thought that not opening embassies in other countries showed the superiority of Ottomans as opening an embassy meant recognizing the other country. Selim was aware of the importance of democratic relations with other countries. Nizam-i Cedit (New Order) Selim created a new army called Nizam-i Cedit based on Western principles. It was the first of its kind in Ottoman history. Janissaries refused to join the new army, but the army became successful. They beat Napoleon’s army in Egypt. Selim also invited French instructors to train new soldiers. This also is a key indicator of good French-Ottoman relations. Janissaries Janissaries played a key role in the Ottoman army. They were meant to be loyal servants to the sultan. They were supposed to be a part of the military alone. It was forbidden for them to marry and have children. However, after Selim’s military reforms such as the new army, they started vocally protesting. They started to get married, have children, and get involved with trade. Janissaries became a part of society, not the state. These were alarming developments for the sultan. Kabakci Mustafa In the year 1807, Kabakci Mustafa led the Janissaries to a rebellion against the sultan. Selim was forced the disband the new army, and step down as the sultan. His cousin Mustafa IV became the new sultan.",

    "title": "Tanzimat Era",
    "content": "Tanzimat Era Tanzimat (to regulate) Era is an era of reforms. Through the Tanzimat and Islahat edicts, power shifted from the sultan to bureucracy. The sultans of this era Abdulmecit and Abdulaziz were not so effective. Bureucrats such as Ali Pasha, Fuat Pasha, and Mustafa Resit Pasa stand out. Reforms Sultans Tanzimat Edict Islahat Edict Young Ottomans Reforms Reasons The main reason behind the reforms was the thereatening aspect of emerging global modernity. Problems There were 3 main problems with the reforms: They created a duality. New rules were not completely able to replace old traditions. Their top-down nature contradicted with the values they were supporting. Reforms came directly from the top without much regard for public opinion. Reactions. Neither Muslims nor non-Muslims were happy with the reforms. Legacy The reforms reinforced duality in almost all areas of life. The idea of Ottomanism did not have much effect on non-Muslim people. Contradiction of bureucratuc centralization and political fragmentation. Majalla: A combination of French penal code and court decisions made by kadis. Written by Ahmet Cevdet Pasha. Clashes New Old Civil courts Sharia courts Modern universities Old medresses An academy of modern sciences Ulema gatherings European theater Traditional shadow puppet show The novel Divan poetry Sultans Abdulaziz Mithat Pasha staged a coup against Abdulaziz. Abdulaziz was taken into custody. It is not certain whether he was killed or he committed suicide. Mithat Pasha starts looking for someone who can perform reforms and end the Tanzimat Era. Murat V becomes the new sultan. Murat V His mental health was not good. Mithat Pasha did not see him as the reformist he wanted so he was able to reign for 93 days. Abdulhamid II became the new sultan. Tanzimat Edict Recited by Mustafa Resit Pasha in Gulhane Park in 1839. First time that a sultan says they are responsible for well-being of all people. The idea is to replace difference with equality. Up until now, the official ideology was sharia. Now the goal is to replace it with a new idea of Ottomanism to deal with seperatist movements. New Laws Reforms in taxation Tax collection process was unfair. Got rid of intermediary people collecting taxes and state started to appoint official tax collectors. Military Conscription Only Muslims were doing military service until that time, and non-Muslims were paying taxes in return of not having to do military service. From now on, everyone will join the army for a certain service time. Judicial Processes Confiscation of property is outlawed. Bribary outlawed. It was very common. Execution without trial is outlawed. Security Guarantee for life, honor and property of all subjects. Responses Muslims did not like the reforms. There was no more sharia. They also believed that the changes were imposed by Western powers. Non-Muslims did not like the reforms either. They did not want to join the army. There were also problems with minorities not accepting being equal with other minorities. Islahat Edict Announced in 1856, Islahat Edict is a more detailed elaboration of the previous reforms. Principle of equality is highlighted more importantly than the Tanzimat Edict. Non-Muslims are invited to form assemblies to reorganize their affairs. Everybody is eligible for official appointment. Non-Muslims had to convert in the past. Non-Muslims are allowed to join civil and military schools. Non-Muslims can pay some money be exempt from military service. (Bedel-i Askeri) Mixed courts are formed. Muslims and non-Muslims can both bring their cases. (Nizamiye) Young Ottomans Founded as a secret society in 1865 by a group of Ottoman individuals, such as Namik Kemal, Sinasi, Ziya Pasha, and Midhat Pasha. They were publishing opposition journals abroad. They came back home in 1871. They were against the Tanzimat Reforms. Political Views They criticisized the Tanzimat as a capitulation to European dictates. They claimed that adoption of European laws had resulted in a tyranny. Economic reforms were irresponsible, lead to the destruction of Ottoman industry and accumulation of debt. They supported a synthesis of Western and Islamic values. A constitution is necessary and a parliament should control the sultan. (constitutional monarchy) They believed in the corrosive effects of power. Seperation of power. (Kuvvetler ayriligi) - Montesquieu They thought that some Islamic doctrines supported similar values with Western contemporary ideas. Commanding right and forbidding wrong. Consultation. (democracy) Their Legacy They inspired future movements in the Islamic world such as Iran. Subsequent generations in the Empire tended to ignore the Islamic content and focused on the patriotic Ottomanism of Namik Kemal.",

    "content": "World War 1 (1914 - 1918) Before the War End of the War Before the War The war was inevitable after the Balkan Wars. Matters were heated. Ottomans knew they could not survive without the support of a great power. They start negotiating with different countries, but side with Germany in the end. Why did Ottomans side with Germany? They did not want to be isolated during the war. Germans didn’t have that much of a territorial desire over Ottoman lands, unlike other countries. People thought the war would only be with Russia (neighbors). They underestimated the scale of the war. Why did Germans side with Ottomans? Germans hoped that the caliph could use his religious power to make Muslims declare jihad against the English in their colonies. They could increase the number of fronts and distract the enemies. They gained control of the straits. Controlling the routes to colonies of other great powers was important. Ottomans officially entered the war after German ships Goeben and Breslau bombed Russian ports with Ottoman flags. Ottomans faught on three fronts: Caucasus Gallipoli Arabian fronts End of the War Mehmet VI (Vahdettin) became the new sultan. There was a power vacuum in Istanbul. The sultan was willing to comply with the demands of the British. CUP members had left the country with a German submarine, but they still had strong presence in the army and the parliament. Karakol Cemiyeti (The Guard Organization) An underground organization founded by Enver and Talat Pashas. They start smuggling arms, weaponry and manpower to Anatolia. It will be difficult to do those things after the Mudros Treaty is signed. This movemement creates an important infrastructure for Mustafa Kemal. Mudros Treaty Signed in 1918 by a committee led by Rauf Orbay. England has the rights to take action in case of any problems in Vilayet-i Sitte (six provinces) and anywhere else in the Empire. Communications in the Empire are controlled by the Allied Powers. Ottoman army is disbanded. Bolshevik Revolution Trotsky shared details of secret agreements signed between Allied countries. Constantinople Agreement Control of the straits given to Russia. Treaty de London Western Anatolia given to Italy. Sykes Picot Agreement Divided the Arab Middle East into zones of influence. South Mesopotamia given to British, and Syria to France. St Jean de Maurienne Territories given to France and Italy in Anatolia. Arabian Rebellion English instigated a rebellion against the Ottomans in the Arabian peninsula. Balfour Declaration British minister wrote a letter to the Jewish community promising them a homeland in Palestine. Sevres Treaty Izmir and Eastern Thrace given to Greece. Straits internationalized. An independene Armenian Republic founded. France established mandates in Syria and Lebanon. British took control of Palestine and Southern Syria. Italy received Southeastern part of Anatolia. Kurdistan was left to Ottomans, but was to receive autonomy and the right to appeal for independence within a year to the League of Nations. Capitulations were reinstated. Wilson’s Principles Woodrow Wilson was the US president. Principle of National Self-determination The Turkish portion of the present Ottoman Empire should be assured sovereignity. Other nations under current Turkish rule should be granted the same rights. Dardanelles should be opened as a free passage.",
