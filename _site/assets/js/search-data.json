    "title": "Mahmud II",
    "content": "Mahmud II (1808 - 1838) Mahmud II replaced his brother Mustafa as the sultan. He made wide-ranging reforms following in the footsteps of Selim. ‘Personality’ ‘Sened-i Ittifak’ ‘Reforms’ ‘Vaka-i Hayriye’ Personality People called him the gavur(infidel) sultan because of the stubborn, single-minded nature of his reforms without and regard for public demands. He understood the importance of a self-image (as with many rulers after the French Revolution) and wanted to expose himself to his people. He put his portrait in state offfices. Sened-i Ittifak Mahmud thought that he had to come to term with local notables to perform his reforms even though it was unusual for a sultan to do so. He signed an agreement with them in 1808. The empire became more centralized as a result. Even though he signed the document, he never ratified it. This shows his reservations about the agreement. He will still do anything to get rid of local notables. Reforms He performed reforms in many different areas. He increased the number of people working for the state. Created the first postal service, and planned projects for expanding the road network. The first census was performed. To gather information and see who was eligible for military service. Women were not included in the census. The first official newspaper was published. Cofeehouses became important places for sharing of ideas. Sultans sent spies to coffeehouses to gather information. He opened the translation office. Opened a medical school. In those times, a good education meant either religious or military education. Medical school provided a new, more scientific method of learning more in tune with the rest of the world. Small exchange programs to send students abroad. In an expedition to Morocco, he saw and decided to adopt fez, thinking that it unifies people under one view. This caused a lot of criticism. The first fez factory was created in Feshane. Vaka-i Hayriye Mahmud invited janissaries to an event in a square, in 1828. Turns out if was a trap and janissaries were attacked from all angles once they entered the square. This practically destroyed janissaries. He created a new army, called Victorious Army of Muhammad.",

    "content": "Mustafa IV (1807 - 1808) Became the sultan after Selim was dethroned. Got along well with Janissaries, did not question much. Deposed by rebels led after Alemdar Mustafa Pasha and replaced by his brother Mahmud II. ‘Rise to Power’ ‘Alemdar Mustafa Pasha’ Rise to Power Mustafa became the new sultan after Selim left the throne in an eventful manner. With his reign, Janissaries (whom he got along well with) started finding and murdering people who supported Selim and his reforms. Alemdar Mustafa Pasha Alemdar was a reformist commander, supporting Selim. After Selim’s fall, he brought his army from Bulgaria to Istanbul to bring Selim back but Selim was already executed. They fought against the rebels led by Kabakci Mustafa and suppressed them. They took control. When Mustafa IV learend of these events, he ordered Selim and Mahmud to be killed and Selim’s body was shown to Alemdar’s people. Afterwards, they dethroned Mustafa and Mahmud, who managed to overcome the hitmen sent by his brother, became the new sultan. Therefore, Mustafa’s efforts to rollback Selim’s reforms failed. His successor Mahmud was also a reformist.",

    "title": "Selim III",
    "content": "Selim III (1789 - 1807) Took the throne in 1789. He was a reformist. Opened new schools, embassies, and created a new army. He was eventually dethroned and imprisoned by the Janissaries. His cousin Mustafa IV became the new sultan. ‘Personality’ ‘State of the Empire’ ‘Reforms’ ‘Nizam-i Cedit’ ‘Janissaries’ ‘Kabakci Mustafa’ Personality Selim was a well-educated, modernist sultan. He had a cautious personality. Did not want to cause problems with reforms considering the state of the Empire. State of the Empire When Selim became the sultan, the Empire was not in good shape. There was an economic crisis and protests against tax rates. There were nationalistic rebellions emerging in the Balkans. Reforms Opened new engineering schools. Opened new embassies in major European capitals. Before then, it was thought that not opening embassies in other countries showed the superiority of Ottomans as opening an embassy meant recognizing the other country. Selim was aware of the importance of democratic relations with other countries. Nizam-i Cedit (New Order) Selim created a new army called Nizam-i Cedit based on Western principles. It was the first of its kind in Ottoman history. Janissaries refused to join the new army, but the army became successful. They beat Napoleon’s army in Egypt. Selim also invited French instructors to train new soldiers. This also is a key indicator of good French-Ottoman relations. Janissaries Janissaries played a key role in the Ottoman army. They were meant to be loyal servants to the sultan. They were supposed to be a part of the military alone. It was forbidden for them to marry and have children. However, after Selim’s military reforms such as the new army, they started vocally protesting. They started to get married, have children, and get involved with trade. Janissaries became a part of society, not the state. These were alarming developments for the sultan. Kabakci Mustafa In the year 1807, Kabakci Mustafa led the Janissaries to a rebellion against the sultan. Selim was forced the disband the new army, and step down as the sultan. His cousin Mustafa IV became the new sultan.",
