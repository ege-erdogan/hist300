<p>He chose to live in the Yildiz Palace rather than Dolmabahce thinking it was more secure.</p>

<p>He appointed Mithat Pasa as the grand vizier.</p>

<h2 id="basic-elements-of-the-hamidian-rule">Basic Elements of the Hamidian Rule</h2>

<p><strong>Back to patrimonialism.</strong> The palace gained power again with the abolishment of the parliament and the constitution.</p>

<p><strong>Suppressed all forms of opposition.</strong></p>

<p>He established a new spy network and started the system of <em>journals</em>: People reporting each other to the government.</p>

<p>New traditions were invented:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Friday prayers became ceremonial events.</li>
  <li>Ottoman coat of arms.</li>
  <li>Title of caliph began to be used for political purposes.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>He followed a pan-Islamic policy.</strong> Aimed to unite all Muslims beyond their nationalities. This was a key part of the foreign policy.</p>
