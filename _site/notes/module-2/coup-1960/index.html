<hr />

<p>There was discontent and protests against the government. US aid from the Truman Doctrine and the Marshall plan was running out.</p>

<p>On <strong>May 27, 1960</strong>, Alparslan Turkes announced on radio that the armed forces were taking over the government.</p>

<p><strong>People who carried the coup were low-ranking soldiers. Top soldiers in the army did not know about the coup.</strong></p>

<p>They proposed close alliances with NATO and the US. American involvement in the coup is argued.</p>

<p>Army officials had a Western education aligned with NATO values.</p>

<h2 id="national-unity-committee">National Unity Committee</h2>

<p>Army officials formed the <strong>National Unity Committee</strong> (Milli Birlik Komitesi) headed by <strong>Cemal Gursel</strong>. It contained 38 officers.</p>

<p>Cemal Gursel was a senior soldier with no involvement leading to the coup. He was brought to Ankara from Izmir. He is chosen the PM, and minister of defence. <em>This gives the message that this is not simply a change of government.</em></p>

<p>A law professor (Siddik Sami Onar) prepared a report justifying the acts of the army.</p>

<p>There are two factions in the NUC:</p>
<ol>
  <li>People like Cemal Gursel propose to create a plan and transfer the power back to the people.</li>
  <li>Alparslan Turkes’ group says they cannot trust civilians. Menderes and others should learn their lesson.</li>
</ol>

<p>On November 13, 1960, Cemal Gursel announces that NUC was disbanded and a new committe was founded.</p>

<h2 id="1961-constitution">1961 Constitution</h2>

<p>Siddik Sami Onar and his friends developed a new constitution. It stayed in effect from 1961 to 1980.</p>

<p>It was progressive compared to the 1982 constitution.</p>

<p>The 1924 constitution had a specific agenda. It provided what was needed to perform reforms. <strong>No seperation of powers.</strong></p>

<p>The main aim of the new constitution was to prevent the occurence of a power monopoly such as DP, or CHP by counter-balancing the parliament with other institutions. <strong>Seperation of powers should be clearly established.</strong> Powers of executives should be limited.</p>

<p>They took some measures to make legislation more difficult</p>
<ul>
  <li>A new senate was created.</li>
  <li>All legislation had to pass through both chambers. Parliament could overrule a senate veto with 2/3 majority. Legislation became more time-consuming as a result.</li>
  <li>All MGK members became members of the senate. 1/3 was elected with elections. 1/3 was selected by the president.</li>
  <li>A <strong>constitutional court</strong> was formed. It could stop any legislation it deemed unconstitutional.</li>
</ul>

<p>The universities and the mass media were given full autonomy.</p>

<p>Bill of civil liberties was introduced.</p>

<p><strong>Military was given a constitutional role for the first time with the introduction of the MGK.</strong> Civilian and military officials were together. It is led by the president. Military wanted to take a role in politics as they did not trust civilians.</p>

<h2 id="election-law">Election Law</h2>

<p>The election law was changed as well.</p>

<p>Proportional representation was introduced to lessen the chance of one party gaining large majority such as DP.</p>

<p>Everyone is represented according to their votes.</p>

<h2 id="trial-of-the-old-regime">Trial of the Old Regime</h2>

<p>Democrats were arrested right after the coup and taken to Yassiada. The party was closed.</p>

<p>Judges made no effort to hide their distaste. They were rude against the accused.</p>

<p>Namik Gedik, minister of the interior, committed suicide.</p>

<p>People over 65 were not executed.</p>

<p>4 people were sentenced to death:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Adnan Menderes</li>
  <li>Hasan Polatkan</li>
  <li>Celal Bayar (not executed)</li>
  <li>Fatin Rustu Zorlu</li>
</ul>
