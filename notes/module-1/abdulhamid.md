## Major Reforms of the Hamidian Era

**Tribal schools were opened.** They were schools in Istanbul. Children of important remote tribes were invited. The goal was to create a new type of bond that will encourage solidarity between people of the Empire. It was also hoped that those children would become supporters of the government when they go back home.

A scattered organization with people living at different places.

Mostly consists of people writing articles about science, progress etc.

### 1895 - Ottoman Committee of Union and Progress

### 1902 - Congress of Ottoman Liberals

An attempt at organizing the opposition.

Two factions emerge: *Ahmed Riza* and *Prince Sabahaddin*

|Ahmed Riza|Prince Sabahaddin|
|--|--|
|Rejects foreign intervention.|In favor of working with Britain.|
|Supports maintenance of the centralized approach.|In favor of a more decentralized approach, thinking that happiness of people can be increased by giving them more autonomy.|

In the end, Ahmed Riza's faction gains the upper hand. 

## The 1908 Revolution

### Road to the Revolution

Soldiers freshly out of college were sent to Macedonia to deal with a local resurgion. They see that Abdulhamid is not able to control the situatio, and that *loyalty is more important than merit.* People close to the sultan are promoted more faster.

Civilians are unhappy as well. In 1906, Talat bey establishes the **Ottoman Freedom Society**, to join the CUP later on.

**CUP members decide they need a strong ally to overthrow the sultan.** So they start forming an alliance with the army, who already contains many unhappy soldiers. **CUP starts recruiting members from the army.**

Rumors about an Anglo-Russian alliance about reforms in Macedonia causes them to take action.

Two people need mentioning: 

* **Resneli Niyazi**: He started a rebellion with 200 people. They started bombarding the Yildiz Palace with telegrams. 

* **Enver Bey**: He helped convert army officers into gang members.

**In 1908 Abdulhamid issued a decree for convening of a new chamber of deputies.**

### Political Vision of the Revolution

*Liberty, equality, fraternity, and justice.*

They support a constitutional monarchy based on the rule of law around a meritocratic parliamentary democracy.

Design a new Ottoman identity united against European interventions. 

Free press and individual liberties. 

**Elections are held in 1908.**

CUP members do not come to Istanbul right away. They stay in Thessaloniki but continue the reformist agenda. 

## 31 March Incident

In 1909, **all the groups against CUP's reforms rebelled,** including Abdulhamid supporters, socialists etc.

**CUP created an army marching to the Ottoman capital** (action army). The army is led by **Mahmut Sevket Pasa.** They suppress the rebellion. 

After the incident, **Abdulhamid is deposed** and sent to Thessaloniki. **Mehmet Resat becomes the new sultan.**

### CUP Measures After the Incident

Martial law.

Strikes are banned. 

Labor unions are dissolved.

Freedom of press is restricted.

## Second Constitutional Period

Power struggle for CUP continues.

**Freedom and Accord Party** is founded in 1911 against the CUP in the parliament. 

The country is in constant battles until 1922: 

### 1911 - War in Tripoli

Tripoli was the last African territory left. 

Troops were organized against an Italian invasion.

### 1912-13 Balkan Wars

Serbs, Greeks, and Bulgarians joined forces and declared war on Ottomans. Ottomans lost the first war and retreated back to Edirne. 

Ottomans recaptured Edirnce when the Balkan nations were fighting against each other over territory claims. 

Turkish nationalism gained momentum.

### 1913 - Bab-i Ali Coup
