# Tanzimat Era

> *Tanzimat (to regulate) Era* is an era of reforms. Through the Tanzimat and Islahat edicts, power shifted from the sultan to bureucracy. The sultans of this era Abdulmecit and Abdulaziz were not so effective. Bureucrats such as Ali Pasha, Fuat Pasha, and Mustafa Resit Pasa stand out.

## Reforms

### Reasons

The main reason behind the reforms was the **thereatening aspect of emerging global modernity.**

### Problems

There were 3 main problems with the reforms:

1. They created a **duality**. New rules were not completely able to replace old traditions. 

2. Their **top-down nature** contradicted with the values they were supporting. Reforms came directly from the top without much regard for public opinion.

3. **Reactions**. Neither Muslims nor non-Muslims were happy with the reforms. 

### Legacy

The reforms reinforced duality in almost all areas of life. 

The idea of Ottomanism did not have much effect on non-Muslim people. 

Contradiction of bureucratuc centralization and political fragmentation.

**Majalla**: A combination of French penal code and court decisions made by kadis. Written by Ahmet Cevdet Pasha.

## Sultans

### Abdulaziz

Mithat Pasha staged a coup against Abdulaziz. 

Abdulaziz was taken into custody. It is not certain whether he was killed or he committed suicide. 

Mithat Pasha starts looking for someone who can perform reforms and end the Tanzimat Era. 

**Murat V** becomes the new sultan.

### Murat V

His mental health was not good. Mithat Pasha did not see him as the reformist he wanted so he was able to reign for 93 days. 

**Abdulhamid II** became the new sultan.

## Tanzimat Edict

Recited by **Mustafa Resit Pasha** in Gulhane Park in **1839**.

First time that a sultan says they are responsible for well-being of **all** people. The idea is to replace difference with equality.

Up until now, the official ideology was sharia. Now the goal is to replace it with a new idea of Ottomanism to **deal with seperatist movements.**

### New Laws

|**Reforms in taxation**|Tax collection process was unfair. <br><br> **Got rid of intermediary people collecting taxes and state started to appoint official tax collectors.**|
|**Military Conscription**|Only Muslims were doing military service until that time, and non-Muslims were paying taxes in return of not having to do military service. <br><br> From now on, **everyone will join the army for a certain service time.**|
|**Judicial Processes**|Confiscation of property is outlawed. <br><br> Bribary outlawed. It was very common. <br><br> Execution without trial is outlawed.|
|**Security**|Guarantee for life, honor and property of all subjects.|

### Responses

**Muslims did not like the reforms**. There was no more sharia. They also believed that the changes were imposed by Western powers.

**Non-Muslims did not like the reforms either.** They did not want to join the army. There were also problems with minorities not accepting being equal with other minorities.

## Islahat Edict

Announced in **1856**, Islahat Edict is a more detailed elaboration of the previous reforms. 

**Principle of equality** is highlighted more importantly than the Tanzimat Edict.

**Non-Muslims are invited to form assemblies to reorganize their affairs.**

**Everybody is eligible for official appointment.** Non-Muslims had to convert in the past. 

**Non-Muslims are allowed to join civil and military schools.**

**Non-Muslims can pay some money be exempt from military service.** (Bedel-i Askeri)

**Mixed courts are formed.** Muslims and non-Muslims can both bring their cases. (Nizamiye)

## Young Ottomans

Founded as a secret society in **1865** by a group of Ottoman individuals, such as **Namik Kemal, Sinasi, Ziya Pasha,** and **Midhat Pasha**.

They were publishing opposition journals abroad.

They came back home in 1871. 

They were **against the Tanzimat Reforms.**

### Political Views

They criticisized the Tanzimat as a **capitulation to European dictates**. They claimed that adoption of European laws had resulted in a tyranny. 

**Economic reforms were irresponsible**, lead to the destruction of Ottoman industry and accumulation of debt. 

**They supported a synthesis of Western and Islamic values.**
* A constitution is necessary and a parliament should control the sultan. (constitutional monarchy)
* They believed in the corrosive effects of power.
* Seperation of power. (Kuvvetler ayriligi) - Montesquieu

They thought that some Islamic doctrines supported similar values with Western contemporary ideas. 
* Commanding right and forbidding wrong.
* Consultation. (democracy)

### Their Legacy

They inspired future movements in the Islamic world such as Iran. 

Subsequent generations in the Empire tended to ignore the Islamic content and focused on the patriotic Ottomanism of Namik Kemal.
