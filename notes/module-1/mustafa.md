## Rise to Power

Mustafa became the new sultan after Selim left the throne in an eventful manner.

With his reign, Janissaries (whom he got along well with) started finding and murdering people who supported Selim and his reforms. 

## Alemdar Mustafa Pasha

Alemdar was a reformist commander, supporting Selim.

After Selim's fall, he brought his army from Bulgaria to Istanbul to bring Selim back but Selim was already executed. 

**They fought against the rebels led by Kabakci Mustafa and suppressed them.** They took control. 

When Mustafa IV learend of these events, he ordered Selim and Mahmud to be killed and Selim's body was shown to Alemdar's people. 

**Afterwards, they dethroned Mustafa and Mahmud, who managed to overcome the hitmen sent by his brother, became the new sultan.**

**Therefore, Mustafa's efforts to rollback Selim's reforms failed. His successor Mahmud was also a reformist.**
