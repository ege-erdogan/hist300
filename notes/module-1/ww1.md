## Before the War

The war was inevitable after the Balkan Wars. Matters were heated. 

Ottomans knew they could not survive without the support of a great power. They start negotiating with different countries, but side with **Germany** in the end.

### Why did Ottomans side with Germany?

They did not want to be isolated during the war. 

Germans didn't have that much of a territorial desire over Ottoman lands, unlike other countries.

**People thought the war would only be with Russia** (neighbors). They underestimated the scale of the war.

### Why did Germans side with Ottomans? 

Germans hoped that **the caliph could use his religious power to make Muslims declare jihad** against the English in their colonies. 

They could increase the number of fronts and distract the enemies.

**They gained control of the straits.** Controlling the routes to colonies of other great powers was important.
