The starting date for the War of Independence is officially when Mustafa Kemal is sent to Samsun to deal with local issues. 

**He starts organizing meetings** attended by lots of former CUP members.

* **Amasya Circular (21-22 June):** Decided upon that sultan is unable to control the situation.

* **Erzurum Congress (23 July):** Mustafa Kemal resigned from his official duty.

* **Sivas Congress (4-11 Sept.):** Mustafa Kemal started preparing a document that will be the roadmap for the national struggle (*Misak-i Milli*). The langauge is deliberately kept vague.

## Misak-i Milli

Territories inhabiited by an *Ottoman* Muslim majority form an indivisible whole united in religion, race, and aim.

Plebiscite (referendum) for decisions on certain areas such as the Arab provinces, Kars, Ardahan and Batum.

Economic independence.

Since **this document should have some official recognition to make people believe in it, Mustafa Kemal sends it to the Ottoman assembly in Istanbul.** Deputies show their support and share it with the public.

Important intellectuals who can shape public opinion are sent to Malta after the British request.

**The British invade Istanbul and shut down the parliament.**

## Tekalif-i Milliye

A set of decisions announced to gain support for the military.

**Pepople give 10% of their belongings to the army for support.**

## Istiklal Mahkemeleri

Courts opened to deal with army deserters. There is no chance to appeal. Executed.

## Political Course

The movement focuses more an Islam rather than nationalism. They want to create a religios solidarity.

## Progress of the War

As the war progressed, those fighting for the other side started to question their involvement in the war. 

* Greek government that joined the war was overthrown.
* Britain had its own problems with Ireland.
* France had problems with its mandate regimes in the Middle East.
* Italy was unhappy with the role of Greeks.
* Soviets supported the Ankara government.

**Dumlupinar (30 August 1922): Victory Day**

## Lausanne Conference

Lasted 8 months in two rounds during 1922-23.

They invited delegates from both governments. **This made the Ankara government angry.**

As a result, **sultanate was abolished in November 1, 1922**. The Ottoman dynasty left the country with 150 people.

The delegation was led by **Ismet Inonu**.

### Treaty

Goals of the national pact were achieved to a large extent.

**Political and economical independence of the new state recognized.**

Mosul stayed in Iraq under British rule. 

Sancak of Alexandrette (Hatay) remained with French Syria.

Aegean Islands remained with Greece and Italy.

Anatolian and Eastern Thrace became part of the new state.

No mention of Armenia or Kurdistan.

Straits internationalized and demilitarized. Controlled by a commission led by Turkish official.

Capitulations remained abolished. Turkey still had to honour all existing foreign conessions and it was not free to change its rules until 1929. *Ottoman debt was paid until 1954.*

Turkey will protect its citizens regardless of race, language etc. Minorities are defined according to their religions. Kurds weren't classified as a minority.

**Population exchange between Turkey and Greece**, was the largest one until that point in history. As a result Turkey lost a significant group critical in terms of knowledge.
