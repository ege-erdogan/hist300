## Proclamation of the Republic

Proclamation of the Republic in 1923 caught a lot of people by surprise. It was not a widely discussed idea.

### People's Party 

Called the **Republican People's Party** later on.

Issues like giving too much power to one man started to be considered more with the first few years bringing a struggle for power.

## Caliphate

The title of caliph was not abolished with the sultanate.

**Abdulmecit Efendi** was the last caliph. He was a religioud scholar and a respected man. He supported Mustafa Kemal.

Mustafa Kemal was disturbed with the idea of another authority figure.

**Caliphate was abolished in 1924**. 

## New Constitution

The new constitution of 1924 focused on unity of powers rather than seperation.

**The first opposition party was created.** (Progressive Republican Party)

They were Mustafa Kemal's old friends. More liberal economically, respective towards religion, and the criticisized the authoriarian practices of CHP. Gained a strong following. 

## Sheikh Sait Rebellion

Sait was a tribal leader in SE Anatolia. 

**He revolted in 1925 motivated by religious motives and Kurdish nationalism.**

Could not be successful because of the Alevi-Sunni division among Kurds.

**Against the abolishment of caliphate. A new Kurdish state was promised in Sevres.**

**Martial law was announced** after the suppression of the revolt.

## Takrir-i Sukun

Government can shut down any written source at wish. 

Gave the government extensive power for 2 years.

Istiklal courts opened. 

Opposition **including the new party** are silenced.

## Assasination Attempt

A former deputy named Ziya Hursit and other people connected to CUP plotted an assasination against M. Kemal.

They were supposed to attack from a barber shop and then flee to Greece.

**Their aide Giritli Sevki wrote a letter to Ismet Inonu disclosing the plans.**

**The government started a crackdown on former CUP members that extended beyond the assasination.**

People like Kazim Karabekir and Ali Fuat Cebesoy were arrested.

## Economics in the New Republic

The country was in a very bad spot economically.

### Izmir Economic Congress (1923)

People with influence on local monetary issues gathered in Izmir to discuss the economic future of the country.

**Asar tax was eliminated.** It was a 10% tax on agricultural products.

Decided it will take a long time to recover from the departure of Greeks and Armenians who mostly were merchants. A new Muslim merchant class should be created.

**Turkey will be a capitalist state, but it will be the major driving force behind new investments.** Also not opposing foreign investment as local people are not strong enough.

This model is called the *mixed model*.

### Tesvik-i Sanayi Law (1927)

Aimed at promoting industrialization.

Will not be very successful because the economic actors are very weak.

### Great Depression (1929)

The depression that started in the US also affected the rest of the world and the new Turkey.

### Statism (1930 and onwards)

Industrial development and most of the economic activities will be run by the state.

**5-year development pland starting with 1934**.

**Railways** are a major area of investment.

Agrarian production was also decreased after the crisis.

## Free Republican Party

Mustafa Kemal saw that some people were unhappy with economic conditions and wanted their voice to be heard. **He asked his cloes friend Fethi Okyar to create a new opposition party** to relive the tension.

**Okyar had one concern:** He wanted to make sure that M. Kemal would remain impartial to this new party and his own party CHP. As a sign of confidence M. Kemal's sister Makbule signed up for the new party.

**The main goal was that the new party won't be harsh in its opposition.**

However, they accumulated a large support specifically on the Aegean side and won 30 seats in the 1930 election. Adnan Menderes was also a member.

On a trip to Izmir, the governor did not let Okyar give his speech for security concerns. **Okyar realized that he will one way or another clash with M. Kemal if he stays as the head of the party.**

The party was abolished in December 1930, four months after its creation.

## Menemen Incident

People requesting sharia and the caliphate back revolted in Menemen.

A teacher on military service, **Kubilay**, was killed in the fights and his head was put on a spike. 

Reinforcements were sent to the region to deal with the situation.

Protesters were executed.
