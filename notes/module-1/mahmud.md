## Personality

**People called him the gavur(infidel) sultan** because of the stubborn, single-minded nature of his reforms without and regard for public demands. 

He understood the importance of a self-image (as with many rulers after the French Revolution) and wanted to expose himself to his people. **He put his portrait in state offfices.**

## Sened-i Ittifak

Mahmud thought that he had to come to term with local notables to perform his reforms even though it was unusual for a sultan to do so.

He signed an agreement with them in **1808**.

The empire became more centralized as a result. 

Even though he signed the document, he never ratified it. *This shows his reservations about the agreement.*

He will still do anything to get rid of local notables. 

## Reforms

He performed reforms in many different areas.

**He increased the number of people working for the state.**

**Created the first postal service,** and planned projects for **expanding the road network.**

**The first census was performed.** To gather information and see who was eligible for military service. Women were not included in the census.

**The first official newspaper was published.**

**Cofeehouses became important places** for sharing of ideas. Sultans sent spies to coffeehouses to gather information.

**He opened the translation office.**

**Opened a medical school.** In those times, a good education meant either religious or military education. Medical school provided a new, more scientific method of learning more in tune with the rest of the world. 

**Small exchange programs to send students abroad.**

In an expedition to Morocco, he saw and decided to **adopt fez,** thinking that it unifies people under one view. This caused a lot of criticism. The first fez factory was created in Feshane.

## Vaka-i Hayriye

Mahmud invited janissaries to an event in a square, in **1828**.

Turns out if was a trap and janissaries were attacked from all angles once they entered the square. 

This practically destroyed janissaries. 

**He created a new army**, called Victorious Army of Muhammad.
