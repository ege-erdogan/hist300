## Personality

Selim was a well-educated, modernist sultan. 

**He had a cautious personality.** Did not want to cause problems with reforms considering the state of the Empire. 

## State of the Empire

When Selim became the sultan, the Empire was not in good shape. There was an economic crisis and protests against tax rates. 

There were nationalistic rebellions emerging in the Balkans. 

## Reforms

**Opened new engineering schools.**

**Opened new embassies in major European capitals.** Before then, it was thought that not opening embassies in other countries showed the superiority of Ottomans as opening an embassy meant recognizing the other country. Selim was aware of the importance of democratic relations with other countries. 

### Nizam-i Cedit (New Order)

Selim created a new army called Nizam-i Cedit based on Western principles. It was the first of its kind in Ottoman history. 

Janissaries refused to join the new army, but the army became successful. They beat Napoleon's army in Egypt. 

Selim also invited French instructors to train new soldiers. *This also is a key indicator of good French-Ottoman relations.*

## Janissaries

Janissaries played a key role in the Ottoman army. They were meant to be loyal servants to the sultan. 

They were supposed to be a part of the military alone. It was forbidden for them to marry and have children. 

However, after Selim's military reforms such as the new army, they started vocally protesting. They started to get married, have children, and get involved with trade. **Janissaries became a part of society, not the state.**

These were alarming developments for the sultan.

## Kabakci Mustafa

In the year 1807, Kabakci Mustafa led the Janissaries to a rebellion against the sultan. 

**Selim was forced the disband the new army, and step down as the sultan.** His cousin Mustafa IV became the new sultan.
