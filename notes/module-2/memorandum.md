* [Demands of the Memorandum](#demands-of-the-memorandum)
* [1973 Elections](#1973-elections)

---

**Military sends a memorandum to Demirel requesting his resignation**.

Knowing he will face a difficult situation if he can't get the vote of confidence, Demirel thinks he has no chance. He also doesn't want to confront the army and end up like Menderes.

**Unlike 1960, high-ranking officials organized the coup.**

After Demirel resigns, **Nihat Erim**, a professor and member of CHP, is chosen by the parliament and forms a **technocratic** cabinet with people from different parties.

**Atilla Karaosmanoglu** is a key figure in the cabinet. He was working for the World Bank. He becomes the minister of finance.

This cabinet remains in charge until 1973.

## Demands of the Memorandum

Martial law was declared in 11 cities. Cities with Kurdish, student or guerilla actvities. Martial law continues until 1973.

Lots of left-wing people are arrested, tortured and jailed. **Deniz Gezmis, Huseyin Inan, and Yusuf Aslan** were executed in 1972. Many leftists were in prison until general amnesty in 1974.

**TIP** and **Milla Nizam Partisi** (Erbakan) are closed.

### Constititutional Amendments

35 articles from the 1961 constitution are changed. Some changes:
1. Power of the military and executives in the political system is increased.
2. **Law by decree** (KHK) introduced.
3. **State Security Courts** are opened. Special authority was given to them to deal with *enemies of the state.*
4. Public servants are not allowed to register in a labor or trade union.
5. Autonomy of TRT lifted.
6. Autonomy of universities was decreased.

## 1973 Elections

First elections after the memorandum were held in **October 1973**.

CHP, led by Bulent Ecevit, wins the elections with 33.5% but they need a coalition partner.

AP receives 29%.

Before the elections, **Erbakan** had created a new party and it became the major Islamist party.

### Coalition

**Erbakan and Ecevit** form a cabinet. Their common points: 
* They are both against Demirel.
* Both of them are skeptical of big business. They want to state of Anatolian worker people.
* Both are skeptical of European influence.

Difficulties began as soon as possible regarding the number of ministers etc. Ecevit doesn't want to stay with Erbakan for long.
