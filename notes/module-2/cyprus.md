## State of the Island

There were meetings regarding Cyprus in the 60's with Britain's rule in the Middle East coming to an end.
* They planned to give the power to inhabitants of the island according to the population figures and give autonomy to a state.
* Turkey, Britain and Greece were decided to be the guarantor states.
* The new state will be run by a Greek at the top with a Turkish Cypriot VP.

**An independent Cyprus state was created in 1960.**

## Turkish People

Turkish people in the island are facing problems. They feel vulnerable. 

Then PM Inonu proposed to make a move in order to limit the actions of the Greeks. 

He received a letter from US President Lyndon Johnson limiting Turkey's use of American arms in such an event, as the Soviets could get involved if Turkey did so. In response, Inonu says "Yeni bir dunya kurulur ve Turkiye o dunyada yerini alir."

Inonu doesn't decide to intervene in the end. 

## Coup

There is coup against the Greek ruler of the island in 1974. The new ruler is a strong ultra-nationalist. As a result, Turkish people are pushed to the mountains.

Ecevit starts thinking about an intervention, stating that Turkey has the right to do so per the agreement.

## Invasion

**Turkish troops land in July 20.**

Ceasefire negotiations begin in Zurich, but the **Turkish military goes for another attack in August.** This time it is a violation of international law.

An independent KKTC is declared in 1983.

**Turkey faces arms ambargo from US.** That also has something to do with the opium production in Turkey.

## Post-Cyprus

**Ecevit becomes a national hero.** 

He sees this as a chance and wants to get rid of Erbakan to form his own government. So he resigns but fails to form a government.

**Demirel, Erbakan, and Turkes** form a nationalist government without needing a new election. MHP and MSP become critical parties despite their votes adding up to a total of 15%.

> **Nationalist Front**: During the cold war era, right wing parties in Europe joined forces to block the leftists' rise.

Coalition government has internal problems even though they are all right-wing parties. They also face a strong opposition in the parliament by Ecevit.

Street violence amongst left-right groups erupt with 'ulkucu' groups organizing attacks against left-wing groups. Meanwhile Islamists and ulkucus are not getting along well either.

There is a **corruption scandal involving Demirel's nephew.** He is accused of phony export and he escapes to Switzerland. People start blaming Demirel for turning a blind eye to this situation.

**SSC's are also abandoned in 1974.** Demirel doesn't like it and complains a lot.

Meanwhile, **economy is going bad.**
