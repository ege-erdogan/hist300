## Results

|**AP**|Wins with 47% of the votes.|

## Economy

Economy enters a period of crisis after the elections.

Turkey has a lot of foreign debt after periods of heavy industrialization and growth.

Money is devalued as a result, and interest rates go up.

Demirel aims to protect the rural population. He doesn't put extra taxes on them. He taxes the urban population.

## Inside AP

**Ferruh Bozbeyli** leaves AP with Saadettin Bilgic and 47 other people in 1970. They form a new party.

Demirel fails to get a vote of confidence. **He resigns and creates a new government**.

## American 6th Fleet

On **February 1969**, American 6th Fleet sets anchor in Bosphorus. American officers walk around in the streets.

Leftist groups organize a demonstration against soldiers. They try to beat soldiers.

**They then organize a meeting in Taksim by notifying the governor's office.** In response, right wing groups decide to go to Taksim as well and organize a *Bayraga Saygi* meeting. **Clashes happen in Taksim, Beyazit, and other places.**

Right wing groups beat left wing activists. **200 injured and 2 dead** (Ali Turgut Aytac, Turhan Erdogan). Police turning a blind eye to the violence created fury. 

## Leftists

After 1968, following a period of success, unhappy leftists start to organize armed groups. They kidnap soldiers, rob banks etc.

**Things are going out of control from the army's point of view.**
