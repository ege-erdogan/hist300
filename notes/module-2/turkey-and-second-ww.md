Inonu tries to change his owm and CHP's image after the tough WWII period. *National Defense Law* and *Wealth Tax* were introduced during the war.

## Memorandum of the Four

Adnan Menderes, Celal Bayar, Fuat Koprulu and Refik Koraltan submitted a memorandum to the parliament.

They criticisized the **Land Distribution Law**.

## Democratic Party

**Nuri Demirag** had create the first opposition party (Milli Kalkinma Partisi) in 1945 but he is not that successful. 

**Democratic Party was registered in 1946** after they were gradually expelled from CHP.

They are different from CHP in some ways:

* Parties like CHP are known as 'kadro partisi' where a certain principles are followed with certain ideologies. Parties like DP are more relaxed. Instead of focusing on a single ideology, they aim to catch as many people as possible (kitle partisi). *They are more pragmatic*.

## CHP Congress

CHP held an extra-ordinary congress in 1946 that resulted in some important decisions:
1. Inonu will get rid of all his titles.
2. Inonu resigns from his duty.
3. He is elected the president again through an election. He is no longer the eternal leader.
4. The press law was liberalized.
5. Universities are given a certain degree of autonomy.
6. Elections become direct elections.

**Elections of 1947 were brought forward a year to catch the Democrats unprepared.**

## 1946 Elections

They are nicknamed the 'hileli secim'.

**Votes are given openly, counting is done in secret**.

Democrats, thinking this was unacceptable, spoke with Inonu after the election and voiced their concerns. *Celal Bayar asks Inonu to make a statement legitimizing the opposition.*

## 12th July Declaration

A statement was declared in 1947 stating both parties are parties of this country and are legitimate. People are free to choose whatever they want.

Hardliners inside CHP such as Recep Peker were eliminated.

At its 1947 congress, CHP moved closer to the DP programme with two exceptions: 
1. Even though CHP started considering a free market as well, they are still reserved towards things like privitization.
2. The right to strike is not given. DP proposed they would provide it, but they didn't.

Inonu starts adopting a more relaxed approach to things like secularism to fix their image. *In 1948, the first Faculty of Divinity opens in Ankara as well as Imam Hatip Schools*.

## 1950 Elections

Free and fair elections with a turnout rate of 80%.

Everything is based on the idea of majority. **Winner in a city takes all the MP seats.**

DP's main slogan is *"Yeter soz milletin!"*.

**DP win with 53.4% against CHP's 39.8%**. Results in 408 seats against 69.

CHP did not win a single province in the Western part of the country.

**After the election, some army officers approached Inonu and proposed they could nullify the elections and he could remain the leader.** He rejected the offer.

DP people are still concerned about Inonu because of his charisma and power (pasa faktoru).

There will be various moments in the following decade that the relationship between Inonu and Menderes gets tense.
