## Overall View After the Elections

AP won the elections easily with 65% of the votes. Demirel becomes the leader of the central right.

### Workers' Party

They can be considered the other winner of the elections.

They sent 14 deputies to the parliament with 3% of the votes. They become 15 later with Cetin Altan joining them.

**They are a very vocal and organized opposition in the parliament.**

### Economics

**There is a period of high growth until 1969.** Inflation is around 5%, real incomes incraese by 20%, a third of people live in cities.

Demirel is also interested in developing heavy industry (steel, aluminum etc.).

**People decide to start a planning institution** after the unplanned methods of DP. Executives are monitored to make sure they don't do anything stupid.

### Military

Despite high economic growth, Demirel knows that he has to be careful with the military after what happened to Menderes. He adapts a reconciliatory attitude.

**Military expands its power in the political system.** Minister of Defence submits to army officials' requests.

> **Demirel is elected again in 1969 elections**.

## Growth of Political Radicalism on the Left

Rise of TIP, combined with Americans losing their good image as a result of Vietnam resulted in an increase in leftist ideas' circulation.

**Students see themselves as the engines of social transformation**. Universities have full autonomy and the press is free. So students engage in political activism through clubs, such as the debating societies created in major universities by students supporting TIP. They have a very strong presence in Ankara and Istanbul.

**Fikir Kulupleri Federasyonu** becomes their umbrella organization. Later becomes DEV-GENC (1969).

Socialists are divided into two: Russian vs. Chinese.

**Soviet invasion of Czechoslovakia caused a split with WPT (1968).** The invasion was in response to a resurgence in Cz. demanding a more democratic rule. Soviets responded with tanks. Similar events also happened in Hungary later.

As a result, **socialists around the world started to question Soviets' acts**. In Turkey, Mehmet Ali Aybar said socialism cannot be implemented from top. Some people had opposing views. They thought Soviets were after the good of socialism. **TIP lost some blood as a result of this split.**

Meanwhile, there is an event in the parliament in which **~100 deputies from AP attack Cetin Altan after his talk** and he loses an eye.

AP proposes to revoke deputies immunities. In the end, they decide to change the electoral counting system. Some MPs become angry and leave the parliament.

In February 1968, students and other socialists organize a meeting in support of Cetin Altan called **Uyanis Mitingi**. There are violent clashes with right-wing groups and the police. **Sahlanis Mitingi** is organized by right-wing groups in response.

**Some people, thinking there is no way for them to be represented in the parliament, decide to start boycotts.** Ankara and Istanbul are indefinitely shut down. Students occupy the faculty of law in Istanbul. Violent clashes with the police.

There are other student movements in other cities such as Paris and London. 

Dogan Avcioglu, an influential leftist figure, starts publishing **Yon Magazine**. They say Turkey was a semi-colonial state. A revolutionary change led by the army and the intellectuals should be started.
