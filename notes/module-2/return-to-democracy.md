## Post-Coup

There was a referendum on the new constitution. **Accepted with 62%**.
> People were unhappy with what was done to DP. Some were dissappointed against the military.

Parliamentary elections were held in October 15, 1961. New parties were founded before the elections.

* **Adalet Partisi**: Founded by Ragip Gumuspala, a retired high-ranking officer. Suited for the role in the eyes of the military and civilians. Becomes the major right-wing party after the end of DP.
* **Cumhuriyetci Koylu Millet Partisi**: Osman Bolukbasi founded CKMP.
* **Yeni Turkiye Partisi**: Not that strong.
* **Turkiye Isci Partisi**: Did not take part in elections. First party in Turkish history to define itself in ideological ways.

All parties signed a document with the army stating that they will not criticise the coup as a part of their campaign.

## 1961 Elections

CHP (37%) and AP (35%) get majority of the votes and form a coalition. (first coalition government)

**Ismet Inonu becomes the PM.**

The coalition won't last long. It falls apart 6 months later as AP was supporting a general amnesty for ex-DP members.

CHP formed a coalition with YTP and CKMP.

**Inonu resigns after budget meetings in 1965.** A temporary government is formed.

> *The period between 1960-65 was a transitional period in Turkish politics. Right-wing politicians were careful not to upset the military. There were also problems inside the military.*

## Talat Aydemir

He was an officer in the army. He was rejected from the NUC, and he thinks that military should run the country forever and that civilians cannot be trusted.

He gathered many enemies and doesn't have good relations with Inonu.

He attempts two coups in 1962 (sieged Inonu's office, but let him go), and again 10 months later but fails.

He was warned after the first one, but 1,500 people were put to trial.

Later, he was executed with Fetih Gurcan.

## Political Parties

### Adalet Partisi

The founder Ragip Gumuspala died of a heart attack and a fight for leadership begins in the party.

**Suleyman Demirel** is elected against Saadettin Bilgic as the new leader of the party. Bilgic is a more controversial figure.

Demirel has a different background compared to other politicians. He is an engineer with a rural background, used to work for DSI.

There is a pluralistic environment in the 60's. Politics revolve around ideologies. Leftist ideas are on the rise like other places of the world.

### Turkiye Isci Partisi

Created in 1961 by members of the labor unions. They invited intellectuals and lawyers to the party.

**Mehmet Ali Aybar** becomes the leader of the party.

Despite having low votes, they affect other politicians' politics as well.

### CHP 

They joined the '65 elections with a new manifesto => **left of center.**

They aim at a new electoral base with many people migrating to cities from rural areas.

They are also competing with TIP.

## Growth of Political Radicalism on the Right

**Alparslan Turkes** becomes the leader of the *ulkucu movement.* (grey wolves)

He has his own manifesto rejecting capitalism and liberalism.

He joins Osman Bolukbasi's party.

Grey wolves began campaigns to intimidate leftist students. Their acts are mostly reactive. They don't gain a strong support base.

Necmettin Erbakan joins the parliament independently in 1965 and later forms his own party.

> **Erbakan, Demirel, Ecevit, Turkes are major figures of the Turkish political scene between 1965-80.**
