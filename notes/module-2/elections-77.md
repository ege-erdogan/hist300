# 1977 Elections

> Government calls for early elections. All hell breaks loose in Taksim. Ecevit has some plans. 

* [May 1st](#may-1st)
* [Election](#election)

---

The coalition government called for early elections as the situation was getting worse. They wanted to release the tension. 

Ecevit, and leftist ideologies, are on the rise. 

## May 1st

May 1st, Labor Day, is between the decision and the election itself. 

Left-wing supporters want to make this something very big. They want to show their power. DISK invited leftist groups to Taksim.

Around 500,000 people attended the meeting in Taksim.

### Events

First there were two shots fired by sharpshooters placed at strategic locations. Then more shots were heard amongst the panic and tanks started to enter Taksim. 

Those trying to flee rushed to the Kazanci Street, but a parked truck blocking the road caused them to get stuck there. 

35 people died and hundreds were injured.

## Election

CHP got 41% of the votes but cannot form a government alone. Ecevit failed to get vote of confidence with a minority government. 

**Demirel forms a new nationalist government with Erbakan and Turkes.** This time, MHP is more influential. They increased their votes and they got 5 ministries. 

This government did not last long. Rising political violence and economic turmoil caused them to resign. **They resigned in December 1977.**

Ecevit met with AP MP's in Gunes Motel and promises them ministry roles in return of them forming a coalition. People warn him that what he is doing is dangerous under such critical conditions.

**Ecevit can now secure absolute majority and get vote of confidence.** He becomes the PM with the start of 1978 until the end of 1979.
