## Road to 1960

After WW2, the Turkish economy started to follow a different path, focusing on liberalization in politics and economy.

After 1950, with the DP rule, interests of farmers and peasants were put forward. Foreign aid boosted Turkish economy during that period. Agrulcultural industrialization was encouraged by the state.

A downfall period began after 1955. 

There was a society very weak economically and politically when the time came for the 1960 coup. Military officers and Republicans started to talk about what can be done to fix the economic situation?

## Economy after the Coup

Democrates were blamed for not having a clear roadmap. They were acting based on demands of the villagers in order to get their votes. This brought a dynamism to the economy but the country became dependent.

During his time, Inonu was remarkably cautious about the budget. He did not want to give a budget deficit. On the other side, there was a constant budget deficit during the Democrat era. IMF packages were adopted.

## State Planning Office

After the coup, creation of the **State Planning Office** was decided upon. They are given power in the field of economic, social, and cultural planning. (Planning was synonymous with communism for Menderes.)

Debates regarding the role of this institution began. Republicans thought that decisions made by the SPO were binding for both the private and public sectors. Justice Party did not think similarly. They thought that this institution had to be subservient to private enterprise. They had to assist the private sector rather than showing them what to do. 

## Import Substituting Industrialization

A key term of that era was **Import Substituting Industrialization**.

With the first **5 year development plan** in 1963, the aim is to reduce the dependence on developed countries and increase the self-sufficiency of internal actors. 

Imports are replaced with domestic production. Some trade barriers are introduced to keep the local actors away from global competition, and a large domestic market is created to meet the demands of the consumers.

The primary focus is producing **durable goods**. Refrigerators, washing machines, vacuum cleaners become part of every household. As a result of the growing income levels and the quality of life, people start to possess many things, including cars.

This is a model based on an **oligopoly**, where a small number of powerful entities divide the market amongst themselves. This works in the forms of joint ventures with foreign firms.
> Turkish companies had neither the knowhow nor the licenses required to produce some goods. 
> By forming a joint venture with a foreign firm, they gained access to that knowhow and the licenses by providing those companies with some capital and workforce.

An oligopoly removes any competition, so the goods produced are not high quality. After a while, consumers end up paying too much, but getting less in return.

## 70s

This model worked for some time, but became difficult to implement after some time. 

With major decisions being made by politicians rather than experts with the second half of the seventies, lots of inefficient policies were implemented in state enterprises.

With economic trouble, social unrest began as well in the form of street violence. **There is a highly organized workforce.** They use their rights extensively with strikes and protests. This is disturbing capitalist enterprises. 

Meanwhile, Turkey is also suffering from global problems such as the oil prices rising by a factor of four.
