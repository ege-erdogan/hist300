## Situation Before the Events

There was a growing tension between right-left groups, and the military was considering taking action (1980 coup).

Maras is the bottom part of the *Fertile Crescent* designed by Turkes. He wanted to make Central Anatolia the home of the nationalist movement. However, there is also a large Alevite population in the same area.

In December 1978, the movie *When will the Sun Rise?* was being shown in theatres. A movie about a man from Crimea suffering difficulties under the Soviet regime. It has strong nationalist messages.

## Events

While a group of idealists were watching the movie in Cicek Sinemasi, a sound bomb goes off. People start running away saying communists bombed the theatre.

**The following day, two leftist teachers are killed on their way home.**

Leftist groups want to organize a large funeral for them on Friday. Their bodies are not given to them until the Friday prayer. 

They organize the walk right as the right-wing people were leaving the mosque after the prayer. Instead of going awaty, they stay at the mosque and don't allow leftists to perform the funeral. There are violent fights. 

Things get even worse after that. Right-wing groups siege Alevite neighbors and damage their properties. Around 120 people in total die with 1,100 injured.

**Government forces cannot get there on time**, allowing the events to further escalate.

## Aftermath

After the events, 80% of the Alevite population in Maras left the city.

Martial law was declared in 13 cities to prevent the events from spreading to other cities. 

Events of the same nature, though smaller in scale, happen in other places as well. This is the first event signaling the violent divisions in the society. 

## Counter-Guerilla Movements

In various countries, NATO and the US backs up armed groups against the rise of left-wing guerilla groups to take action in case of a communist attack. They are mostly named after historical references (Gladio in Italy, Ergenekon in Turkey).

Ecevit utters the word for the first time in public, saying that he knew nothing about them until he came to power.

After that, the Chief of Staff says they have been receiving money since the 50's to fight against communism. Demirel puts a lot of pressure on him to prove his claims, he is denying such claims. This conflict acts as another destabilizing factor in politics.
